Inline styles overwrite external stylesheets.

In teh style sheet: 

Type selectors (e.g., h1) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before).

Class selectors (e.g., .example), attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"]) and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover).

ID selectors (e.g., #example).

Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~, ' ', ||) and negation 

pseudo-class (:not()) have no effect on specificity. (The selectors declared inside :not() do, however.)
