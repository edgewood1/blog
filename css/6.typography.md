Typography



Font family - each consists of multiple character sets

Roboto includes 6 font weights and 2 variants - normal and italics

There are 3 styles

- Serif: contain adornments
- Sans-serif: lack adornment
- Monospace: 

Custom fonts - these must be downloaded by the browser

A font stack - multiple values so tha thte browser can fall back on others until the download completes or inc ase it fails.  

3 style options for word processing: 

Bold - font-weight

strong tag - critical ly important or urgent; so it has semantic meaning.

Italic - font-style: italic

Underline only used o indicate a link.  we use this to remove a line: 

Text-decoration: none

Alignment

Text-align - shift characters horiontally

Text-transform - capitliaze first or all letters.

spacing

Letter-spacing > horizontal gap between characters

Line-height > the vertical distances between lines - it takes a unitless value.  units also acceptable.  It also works as a ratio, so a value of 2 means twice as tall.  the minimum recommended value is 1.5.  

JSX adds px to fontsize for you: 

```
function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <p style={{ fontSize: 18 }}>
      Hello World
    </p>
  );
}
```
