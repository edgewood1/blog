scrolling is the result of two boxes interacting

- element (parent)
- element's contents (child)

if child is larger than parent, then an overflow occurs.

child overflows parent.
parent is overflowed by child.

so we control the parent's overflow.  

this can be done: 

vsisible - renders outside box (default)
hidden - overflow clipped
scrolling


element's contents

- could be just very long text element
- could be a series of small box element
