flex

```
<div id="container">
  <div id="a">hello</div>
  <div id="b">hello</div>
</div>
```

Flex-basis > creates a baseline

Flex-grow > how to divide up the extra space beyond this baseline? default is 0

flex-shrink > how to divide up the loss of width beneath this baseline? Default is 1

- so if both items are set to flex:200px, yet the container shrinks such that max width of each is 150px - we've lost 50px per containter; however, we could assign a as losing twice as much (`flex-shrink)

demo
parent: 900px
child: 200, 200
remaining space: 500
how to subdivide this space? 
child1: flexgrow: 2 / x
child2: flexgrow: 1 / x
x is the total values = 3
