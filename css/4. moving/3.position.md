by default, a box has 100vw width.

these positions may or may not change that: 

relative - no change

absolute - no width; needs to be explictly applied.

Relative-absolute

absolute - this will align to the 



5 positions

There are five different position values:

- `static` - not affected by table
- `relative` - movement measured from current position
- `fixed` - relative to viewport, so it will stay the same regardless of scroll
- `absolute` - relative to nearest positioned ancestor; if none exist, it uses the document body, moving along with page scroll (unlike fixed). - removed from normal flow and can overlap elements
- `sticky` - relative to user's scroll position.  it toggless between relative and fixed depending on scroll position.  it is relative until a given offset position is met, then it sticks in place - like fixed.
