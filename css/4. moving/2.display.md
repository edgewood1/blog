Block vs. inline display

* Block Elements
  Height = size of content
  Width = span the whole length of container, even if contents don't
  Thus, they always start on a new line. 
  Block elements can wrap other block and inline elements.
  p, divs, headings, etc are all block level

* inline elemetns

Height and width always fit content, so w & h props don't work on it
they align to the left, side-side
if  you want to change sizing, use display (see below)
don't nest block in inline elements, but you can nest inline within inline
the exception - anchor tags can wrap block elements<a><span></span></a>
a, span, strong, - inline

* is element block or inline? 
  add a background color on it.  {background: red}
  if it stretches all the way across the container, it's block.  

block elements can be changed by w and h, but they still start a new line, unlike in-line

* display 
  display: block used on inline 

 - they are affected by h & w
 - but if 2 consecutive inline > block, there's no space between, unlike block 

display: inline-block used on inline 

- accepts h & w 
- line up side-side like inline

display: inline-block on block, similiar

- line up side-side, like inline

display: none - hides element
