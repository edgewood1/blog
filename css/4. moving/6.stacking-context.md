A stacking Context consists of a parent and its children

Below, the root context contains #outer and #outer2

Then #outer has its own inner stacking context

```html
<div id="outer">
  <div id="a"></div>
  <div id="b"></div>
</div>
<div id="outer2"</div> // this z-index is compared to #outer
```



**Stack order (lowest to highest)** within a stacking context

- root
- positioned + negative z-index
- non-positioned
- positioned + zindex: auto
- positioned + 0+ z-index or higher

 

**When a stacking context is formed**

- When an element is the root element of a document (the <html> element)
- When an element has a position value other than static and a z-index value other than auto
- When an element has an opacity value less than 1
- Several newer CSS properties also create stacking contexts. These include: transforms, filters, css-regions, paged media, and possibly others. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context
- As a general rule, it seems that if a CSS property requires rendering in an offscreen context, it must create a new stacking context.

**parent - child** > example of multiple stacking contexts interacting

- yellow (child) is above blue (parent) because in this yellow-blue context, yellow has a higher z-index
- blue is higher than both because in this new stacking context (blue-red), red has a higher context than blue



```html
<div class="box box-red">
  <div class="box box-yellow"></div>
</div>
<div class="box box-blue"></div>

.box-red {
  z-index: 1;
}

.box-blue {
  z-index: 2;
}

.box-yellow {
  // correct?
  z-index: 3;
}
```

 

**Stacking Order 2**

- root element of doc (html)
- position absolute or relative AND z-index other than auto
- position fixed / sticky 
- child of flex AND z-index other than auto
- child of grid ANDopacity less than 1
- mix-blend-mode value other than normal
- elements with transform, filter, perspective, clip-path, mask-*
- element with a isolation value isolate
- with-webkit-overflow-scrolling = touch, 
- will-change valuecontain value of layout, paint, or a composite value...two elements share a stacking context if they share the same parent.
