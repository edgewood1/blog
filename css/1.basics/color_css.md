**Hexadecimal colors**

#RRGGBB

All values must be between 00 and FF.

For example, the #0000ff value is rendered as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to 00.

**RGB colors**

An RGB color value is specified with the rgb() function, which has the following syntax:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color and can be an integer between 0 and 255 or a percentage value (from 0% to 100%).

For example, the rgb(0,0,255) value is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
