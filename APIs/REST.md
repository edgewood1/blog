## What Is REST?

On the other hand, [Representational State Transfer](https://nordicapis.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-rest-api-design/) — or *REST* — is a popular architectural style for software, especially web APIs. It’s defined by five design constraints that, when followed, produce an application with [specific properties](https://nordicapis.com/an-experts-guide-to-choosing-the-right-api-style/), including performance, simplicity, and reliability.

### Constraints

The five basic constraints that define a REST application are:

1. **Client-Server**: The client and server act independently.
2. **Stateless**: The server does not record the state of the client.
3. **Cacheable**: The server marks whether data is cacheable.
4. **Uniform Interface**: The client and server interact in a uniform and predictable way. An important aspect of this is that the server exposes *resources*.
5. **Layered System**: The application behaves the same regardless of any intermediaries between the client and server.
