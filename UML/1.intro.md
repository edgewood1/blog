UML - Unified modeling language

What does it capture / represent?

- an abstract entities’ essence and their relations, processes, and behavior of different systems.

Two variations: 

[**OntoUML**](https://ontouml.org/) -  an ontology-driven conceptual modeling language, practically an extension of UML. For conceptual modeling focusing on the areas where the ontology is critical.



The [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) (Web Ontology Language) was standardized by W3C and “is designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things. OWL is a computational logic-based language such that knowledge expressed in OWL can be exploited by computer programs, e.g., to verify the consistency of that knowledge or to make implicit knowledge explicit.”

The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web language designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things. OWL is a computational logic-based language such that knowledge expressed in OWL can be exploited by computer programs, e.g., to verify the consistency of that knowledge or to make implicit knowledge explicit. OWL documents, known as ontologies, can be published in the World Wide Web and may refer to or be referred from other OWL ontologies. 

 [GUFO](https://nemo-ufes.github.io/gufo/) - a light-weight UFO.  The *Ontology & Conceptual Modeling Research Group* created an OWL version reflecting some aspects of OntoUML.
