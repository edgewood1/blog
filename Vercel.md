What is Vercel
Vercel is a platform designed specifically for frontend developers. It :
	•	builds your app + deploys it.  
	•	serverless functions, allowing you to write code that executes on the server in response to events without managing servers yourself.
	•	integrates with Git version control systems, enabling deployments triggered by Git pushes.
	•	features for team collaboration, including project sharing, access control, and environment management.
Workspaces in Vercel
	•	used in a development structure called a monorepo with Vercel.
	•	A monorepo is a single Git repository that stores the code for multiple projects or applications. It's a way to organize codebases that share dependencies or components efficiently.
Vercel treats each workspace within a monorepo as a separate project. This offers advantages:
	•	Independent Deployments: Vercel can deploy each workspace in your monorepo independently, allowing for faster deployments as they can run in parallel.
	•	Granular Control: You have more control over the deployment process for each part of your application.
Using Monorepos with Vercel
To leverage monorepos with Vercel, you'll need to configure your project structure and deployment settings. Vercel offers documentation and guides to assist you with this process, considering package managers like Yarn Workspaces.
In essence, Vercel's workspace concept caters to developers who use monorepos and want to take advantage of Vercel's deployment features for each component within their larger codebase.
