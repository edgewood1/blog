How do we traditionally change the DOM? 

Document.getElementById('#hello').textContent = "name";

How does this work? 

Here, we use a series of piecemeal, ad-hoc, hard-to-maintain description of DOM operations to execute as a result of user events

It repaints / reflows the whole tree in order to change that one node?

Part 2: Virtual DOM

Here, we use a declarative, purely functional description of a view to render:

The process called "reconciliation" create DOM update operation as a result of 

1. creating a new VDOM version
2. comparing it to the older one by walking both VDOM trees
3. generates a list of operations which change the old tree to look like the new one
4. since this comparison can be expensive for large trees, there are escape hatches: thus, methods that allow des to skip branches of the tree during reconciliation.
5. This is an extra JSX compiliation step.

Part 3: Lit-html

It use s a html template tag that allows declarative description of the DOM without the need for reconciliation.

1. when a variable changes
2. look at template (render method)
3. perform exactly those operations on the corresponding DOM nodes
4. templates are values that can be computed, passed to and from functions and texted.

Lit-html only handles creating / updating DOM nodes

LitElement handles a component model - it adds the possiblity to declaritively define web components with lit-html as a rendering engine.
