nginx - web server so we can server index.html

but to create an app with paths and ways to connect to a db
so we need an application server

node.js or flask are good options - 

node - js engine running on top of v8 (compiler?)
single threaded engine that executes js and handles requests

__1. install node + git__

install nodejs / npm 

sudo apt install nodejs npm

sudo apt install git



__2. setup our node app: take ownership of var/www__

change ownership of `www` directory to current user
so that we don't have to sudo everytime we create a file here:

`sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www`

  $USER is just your username: mel

`cd /var/www`


__3.create an app dir__

mkdir /var/www/app

cd /var/www/app

www is where index.html lives

the app folder can be where our app lives, so we can `git init` this

__4. we could create a directory (or just git clone it?)__

we could also create out directory here

mkdir -p ui/js ui/html ui/css
touche app.js
npm init

couldn't we just clone into this?  

or you could code in your terminal: 

npm i express --save

vi app.js  // write in the vi-editor

write a basic app server: 

const express = require('express')
const app = express();
app.get('/', (res, req)=> {
  res.send('Hello world');
}
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('listening'))

now, in /var/www/app: node app.js

this should run your node app in port 3000

go to: 

jemisthe.best ... defaults to 80, which is the nginx welcom

jemisthe.best: 3000

Now it's running express > 

To manage this...  create a proxy pass

edit nginx config: 

sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

location / {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/
}

so any / request should be routed to port 3000

now, I can run 5 apps and each can be running on different port

restart service: 

sudo service nginx reload

node app.js

service -> what is this?
