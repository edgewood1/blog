SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

SSH enables the same functions -- logging in to and running terminal sessions on remote systems. SSH also replaces file transfer programs, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and rcp (remote copy).

The most basic use of SSH is to connect to a remote host for a terminal session. The form of that command is the following:

ssh UserName@SSHserver.example.com

However we need keys to enter

We find the keys where? 

the host key is stored in the local system's known_hosts file. This is a hidden file, stored by default in a hidden directory, called /.ssh/known_hosts, in the user's home directory. Once the host key has been stored in the known_hosts file, the client system can connect directly to that server again without need for any approvals; the host key authenticates the connection.

This displays the files: 

ls -al ~/.ssh

d-o
d-o.pub
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub // used for github
known_hosts
known_hosts.old

~/.ssh/config  // permission denied

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config  // Edgewood70

open terminal

ssh mel@159.223.96.17

However, I setup an ssh/config file that can manage various hosts.  

ssh do // markham77
