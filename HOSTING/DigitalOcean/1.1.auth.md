__server setup: authentication__ 

two ways to log-in to server
- ssh keys
- one-time password

ssh - secure socket shell
ssh key pair: public (goes on server) / private (secret - stays on yr computer)

all encrypted with a private key
anyone can have a public key
you need it to decrypt a private key encryption
private key never leaves my cpu
i use my private key to create a public key that I send to you.
you use that public key to decrypt my message and to send me stuff.

__create an ssh key _ add it to your server__

This will be your PRIVSTE key
- go to your ssh folder ~ if it doesn't exxist then mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   cd ~/.ssh

- list files

  ls

- generate a public/private rsa key pair:  
ssh key-gen

- Enter file in which to save the key

my-key

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase)

find it

ls l grep my-key

shows two files... 

fef3 // private
fef3.pub // publick key

continued in notes... 



instead: non-root user with root permission
