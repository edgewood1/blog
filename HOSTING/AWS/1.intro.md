**Acount setup**

AWS Managemet Console: Sign In




Secure Account

Secure Root Account with IAM

use google authenticator for MFA

Account ID

Account Alias - change this > thus there's no conflict with url

Go to users / add an "admin" user

- select access: access + password
- custom password
- will have access to everything except billing
- find administrator/access policy

Add a tag (optional) - 

- Metadata about user - way to identify user and teams on the bill

**Setup S3 bucket**

S3 - simple storage services : a key value store

Take things and put on cloud

- you have buckets
- you can put objects (files) in buckets
- you can read from buckets
- you can host web pages out of buckets
- infintely scalable

features

- lifecycle management 
- versioning (we can use git)
- encryption
- security

data consistency model

- putting new objects in S# is immediate
- updating and removing objects is eventually consistent - users might get an old versions
- they put your objects in many places in case - different regions - reliable distributions
- if a region goes down, we're up elsewhere

Other

- uploading is free; charged for storage / requests.
- storage: free 5 GB
- Charged: limit requests to bucket via cloudfront

Diferent buckets

- normal stuff
- infrequently accessed (costs less to keep but more to get)
- Intelig-tier - moves to different places
- glacier - put it out in the shed.

bucket names need to be unique

- and teh same as the url (domain name)
- 

**Setup domain name**

route 53 - DNS service

- register domain > choose doman name
- wildwoodrose.org 

go back to S3 + add bucket to 

- create bucket

- bucket name will be same as domain name: wildwoodrose.org

- pick region 

- ACl. - access control list distabled

- block public access settings for bucket

  - Yes!  but can be turned off.
  - a web page we want access- we'll turn off
  - we'll fix this later

  bucket versioning? -

  - disabled becuase we have GIT
  - it encurs a cost

  we don't need server side encrpyption

**S3 bucket Policies**

- users should read to it, but not write or delete

- Permissions / Bucket Policy
- policy 
- Sid - title / identifier / tag
- principal - who, * is anyone
- effect: allow / deny
- action: what to do (getObject)
- resource: what can they do it to (what bucket: bucket name / keyname)

Amazon resource number- arn:aws:s3:::${BucketName}/${KeyName}.



S3 /objects / upload index.html 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/wildwoodrose/index.html

Fix domain

s3/properties tab

static website hosting enable // add index.html as starter file

Add AWS CLI tool.


.aws/credentials --> create additional profiles

route53

domains / registered domains

- turn off auto-renew

**Add a record**

Dashboard/hosted zones

- edit hosted zones
  - view details - see records
  - Types of records 
  - NS
  - SOA
  - A - 
- select alias
- A record type alias to s3 website endpoint
- choose your region
- see our site - s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
- r

**register ssl search**

Search: certificate manager

request a certificate

request a public cert

write domain name: wildwoodrose.org and www.wildwoodrose.org

DNS validation

==============

**Aws**







A recordd

- maps IP to [wildwoodrose.org](http://wildwoodrose.org)



AAAA record 

- points domain to IP address IPv6



CName - points domain / subdomain to another domain



NS recrods - name server

- provided by hosting provider





mx 

- mail exchanger
- points to email.




1. create bucket
2. set bucket policy: all, principle: *, action: getObject
3. add a record
4. go to certificate manager, request public cert
5. create records in S3
6. create certificate (via cert manager)
7. this adds cname records > create records in route 53
8. now you can go to domain name
9. 




setup www route

route 53 / registered domains / manage dns / select domain / view details

create record

record name: www / alias to s3 website endpoint in use east 1 to www.etc 

CloudFront

it puts your assets on a cdn around the world.  CF will cache our assets in S#, which reduces the number of requests. won't hit s3 bucket at all. 

create a cloudfront distribution (setup).  Distributions are the cloudfront equivalentts of buckets.  distributes app around the world.  CF ignores request headers - it also adds customer headers.  

- don't select the default options for origin domain
- got to s3/buckets/static webhosting  bucket name - use that endpoint
- redirect http to https
- allowed http methods - change this for api use. 
- alternate domain name: wildwoodrose.org // www.wildwoodrose.org
- add custom SSL cert
- default root object: index.html
- submit
- route53
- registered domains / manage dns / view details / select A record / edit / alias to cloudfront distribution.   and select 

Using OAI - origin asccess identity

- lock down bucket but still allow cloudfront to serve it
- you can turn on when setting an origin as an s3 bucket on a CF distribution. 
- CF can wrap anything - S3, e-whatever.  it will do all the caching

Cloudfront > distribution > select yours
select origins tab > select yours > edit origin
origin name - was the one that contains "website"
This S3 bucket has static web hosting enabled. If you plan to use this distribution as a website, we recommend using the S3 website endpoint rather than the bucket endpoint.'

resetric access only to cloud front
create new OAI


Access denied >>> except with /index.html

Secure the S3 Bucket S3 permissions edit

client side routing --still messed up

turn off static website hosting.. 

-- block all public access

disable static website hosting
