dependency injection

- used to provide components with services needed
- components "consume" services
- we inject a service into our component
- our services are dependencies
-  thus, it has access to this service class.
 
Register providers in the @Injectable(), or in the @NgModule() or @Component() decorators

1. At root level, a single, shared instance of HeroService injected to any class that asks for it 

- `ng generate service` - register a provider with the root injector for your service by including provider metadata in the `@Injectable()` decorator.  

  @Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
  })

2. same instance availabe to all componets in NgModule (both BackendService and Logger get the same instance)

@NgModule({
  providers: [
  BackendService,
  Logger
 ],
 ...
})

3. New instance for each new instance that requests

- register a service provider in the providers property of the @Component() metadata.

@Component({
  selector:    'app-hero-list',
  templateUrl: './hero-list.component.html',
  providers:  [ HeroService ]
})
