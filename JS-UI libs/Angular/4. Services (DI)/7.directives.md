References to the DOM can instantiate from any class. Keep in mind that references are still services. They differ from traditional services in representing the state of something else. These services include functions to interact with their reference.

Directives are in constant need of DOM references. Directives perform mutations on their host elements through these references


ng generate directive highlight


// directives/highlight.directive.ts
```js
import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(
    private renderer: Renderer2,
    private host: ElementRef
  ) { }

  @Input() set appHighlight (color: string) {
    this.renderer.setStyle(this.host.nativeElement, 'background-color', color);
  }
}
```

1. The @Directive() decorator's configuration property specifies the directive's CSS attribute selector, [appHighlight].

2. Import ElementRef from @angular/core. ElementRef grants direct access to the host DOM element through its nativeElement property.

3. Add ElementRef in the directive's constructor() to inject a reference to the host DOM element, the element to which you apply appHighlight.

4. Add logic to the HighlightDirective class that sets the background to yellow.
