dependency
- a relative term
- typically, it means a thing that is dependent on another thing to work
- in code, its nearly the opposite. 
- a node module is a dependency because it is used by our main program
- in reality, they are interdependent
- our main program doesn't depend on it - it could use another module
- however, the module requires some program in order to work. 
- the module is "turned on " by another program - our main program
