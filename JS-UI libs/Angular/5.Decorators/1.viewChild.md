 @ViewChild() decorator configures a view query.
 - used to get the first element or the directive matching the selector from the view DOM. 
 - provides the instance of another component or directive in a parent component and then parent component can access the methods and properties of that component or directive.

params: 
- child component name
- directive name
- template variable

we can
- get a child component from the parent componet

For example, if a library ships with a component or directive with a public non-input or non-output property youâ€™d like to change, these decorators would allow you to access and modify them. 

These decorators are also helpful in exposing providers configured in child components to inject dependencies ( like services, configuration values, etc. ) that the main component may not have access to.


ElementRef - like document.getElementById('myId');
- used in only some decorators
- used in basic DOM abstraction
- access basic native element present in DOM

TemplateRef
- access DOM elmeent within template
- structural directive uses this
- can contain many element refs
