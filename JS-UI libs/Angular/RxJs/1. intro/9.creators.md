 __Creation__ 
 these operators turn an object into an observable

 ie, a stream 

 ========================

 - create: aliast to the constructor ~ this is deprecated.  use new Observable() instead. 



 - interval: returns an Observable that emits an infinite sequence of ascending integers, with a constant interval of time of your choosing between those emissions. 

 - fromEvent: Creates an Observable that emits events of a specific type coming from the given event target.

 - of(...items) ~ returns an observable instance that synchronoosly delivers the values provided as argumnts
 - emits value without processing
 - from: allows processing

of(a)
.subscribe(val => console.log(val))


- from(iterable) - converts its arguments to an observable instance - often used to convert an array to an obserable.  l
