The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to class data

Used with:
- input
- select
- textarea

__one-way binding:__

- class prop `this.txtName` sets initial attribute value `txtName`
- as attribute value changes, class prop does not auto-change ~ you must set it yourself, using an event listener
- flow is from class to html

  <input (ngModelChange)="la($event)" type="text" [ngModel]="txtName" />

```js
export class AppComponent {
  txtName = "hi";
  la(e) {
    console.log(e) // this changes with input
    console.log(this.txtName) // this stays "hi"
    this.txtName = e; // you must set class prop
    console.log(this.txtName); // now its updated
    this.txtName = "shark" // changes the html value once, but we can type over it.  it won't change the html again until this property changes to something else... 
  }
}
```
__two-way-binding__

- html > class
- class > html

<input (ngModelChange)="la($event)" type="text" [(ngModel)]="txtName" />

```js
export class AppComponent {
  txtName = 'hi';
  la(e) {
    console.log(e);
    console.log(this.txtName); // class prop updated with each change in input.value
  }
```



Use the NgModel directive to display a data property and update that property when the user makes changes.

one-way data binding

Here, value refers to the string literal
<input value="hello">
Here, value refers to the property:
<input [value]="hello">
<p>output: {{hello}}</p>
value = abc

In the above, data flows from model > view
so I can change the input, and it doesn't affect the model.

===================

ngMdel - requires the use of a model: FormsModule  

[()] - this means 2 way data flow (banana in a box)

<input [(ngModel)]="hello">

Now changing the value in the view, the model / data changes.

Q) but what model is it connected to?


[] - component / model to view
() - view to component / model

Research - 

writing value accessors

__ViewChild can also be sued as a template reference__

@ViewChild('username') // turns template reference variable into a component property
console.log(this.username);

__alternative if TRV didn't exist__

That way, the DOM can basically watch other parts of itself without you having to use any javascript logic yourself (it still gets used.. you just aren't the one writing it). Otherwise, you'd have to write that like this:

<input type="text" id="username" [ngModel]="username" (ngModelChange)="checkForGod()">
<p *ngIf="usernameIsGod">Who you trying to fool?</p>

Then in your controller:

checkForGod() { usernameIsGod = username === 'god' }
