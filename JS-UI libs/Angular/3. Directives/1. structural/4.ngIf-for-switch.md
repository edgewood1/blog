ngIf

x=true
<p *ngIf="x">hello</p>

When x is false, this will disappear

ngIfElse

Guarding against null

if `currentCustomer` doesn't exist, then the dependent text content is ruined.  Therefore, don't bother displaying:

<div *ngIf="currentCustomer">Hello, {{currentCustomer.name}}</div>

Use the NgFor directive to present a list of items.

When working with an array called 'items' whose items are objects such that each object is: 

{name: 'abc'}

ngFor can be used to list items - this will just list names

<div *ngFor="let item of items">{{item.name}}</div>

repeating a component view

This loops through the `items` array
each item in this array is passed into the component

<app-item-detail *ngFor="let item of items" [item]="item"></app-item-detail>


This has to be set up in app-item-detail as: 

`@Input() item: {name: string}`
<h1 *ngIf="item">Hello {{item.name}}</h1>

Getting the index

<div *ngFor="let item of items; let i=index">{{i + 1}} - {{item.name}}</div>

This will print: 
1 - mel
2 - jon
