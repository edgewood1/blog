## Classes

classes - blueprints to create an object wtih felds and functions to represent a thing

```js
class Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("hi")
  }
  honk(): void {
    console.log("now")
  }
}

const my_car = new Vehicle();

class Van extends Vehicle {  // extends copies Vehicle
  honk(): void{
    console.log("we") // this will override the previous honk
  }
}

```

TS classes a little different than in ES6

 modifiers - key words we can use.  here are 3:

- public - method accessible anywhere any time

- private - methods accessed ONLY by other methods of same class

-  protected - methods called yby other methods in this class OR by those in child classes
