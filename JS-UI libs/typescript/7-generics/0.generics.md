Generics let us pass in any type: 

a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one.



TypeScript Generics is a tool which provides a way to create **reusable** components. It creates a component that can work with a **variety of data types** rather than a single data type. It allows users to consume these components and use their own types. Generics ensures that the program is flexible as well as scalable in the long term.

We use the type `any` twice: both for the param & return:

```tsx
function identity(arg: any): any {
  return arg;
}
```

This is the same, but allows us to "pass in the type".  Now the user can pass in `number` or `string` and all is strictly typed

```tsx
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
```

Call the function,passing in an explcit type

```tsx
let output = identity<string>("myString");
```

call function, allowing for type inference: 

```tsx
let output = identity("myString");
```

Next - generic types.
