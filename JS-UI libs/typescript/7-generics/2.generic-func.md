Problem

```
function merge(objA: object, objB: object) {
  return Object.assign(objA, objB)
}

const data = merge({name: 'max'}, ...)


```

it won't know that `data` has a `name` key.

we could typecast - what we get back is an object with certain keys: 

```
const data = merge({name: 'max'}, ...) as {name: string, age: number}
```

OR

```
function merge<T, U>(objA: T, objB: U): T & U { .... }
```

Now when you call teh funciton, it will set these types dynamically

this will fill in different type for each instance

```
const data = merge(...)
```

We could pass in specific types if we don't want variability: 

```
const data = merge<{name: number}, {age: number}>({name: 2}, {age: 2}) 
```

Restrict T U to be objects, but not define the kind of object: 

```
function merge<T extends object, U extends object> 
```

T can be any type of any structure, but must be an object

Example 2

Below, it complains that element does not have length, so create an interface

```
function countAndPrint<T>(element: T) {
  let description = 'got no value';
  if (element.length > 0) {
    description = ` got ${element.length} element
  } else if (element.lnegth > 1) {
    description = `ljl`,
  }
  return [element, description]
}
```

Revised

```
interface Lengthy {
  length: number
}
```

It takes a property that has a length prop
It returns an array that has the same prop + string

```
function countAndPrint<T extends Lengthy>(element: T): [T, string] { ...
```

now we can call with string, array, but not a number because a number doesn't have a 'length' property

Another constraint: "keyof"

```
function extract(obj, key) {
  // this returns a particular key in the object
    return obj[key]
}
```

```
const ace = extract({name: 'max'}, 'name')
// returns 'max', a string
console.log(ace)


```

PROBLEM: 

```
function extract(obj: object, key: string) {
  return obj[key] // problem: object, doesn't have key of string
}
```

Here, we'll take 
- any type so long as its an object,
- any type, so long as its a key in that object 

```
function extract<T extends object, U extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: U) {
  return obj[key] // problem: object, doesn't have key of string
}
```
