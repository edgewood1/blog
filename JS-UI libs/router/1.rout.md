npm install react-router-dom

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";

1. Wrap all in Router
2. Wrap routes in Switch --- what is a switch??
3. routes use path and component

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <div>
      <NavTabs />
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route exact path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route exact path="/blog" component={Blog} />
      <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
    </div>
  </Router>
);
