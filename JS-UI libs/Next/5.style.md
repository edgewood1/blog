__style__

When it comes to styling, you have global styles and component styles. For global CSS, you have to import them at the entry point of your app. Wait, where is the entrance to my Next.js app? It's actually created for you, but you can and have to create your own now that you want **global styles.**

Create an pages/_app.jsx file and add this:

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

This is an entry point.
Allows us to hijack the root / entry point

This automatically gets created for you by default with the same code. In the _app.jsx you can import any CSS file, and the styles will be global now.

import 'flexbox.css'
import '../mystyles.css'


change name:  styles.module.css
adding module to it.
can import into a specific file,
can import into that file and it won't collide
