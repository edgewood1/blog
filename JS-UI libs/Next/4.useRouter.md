In Next.js, there is no concept of `app-router` or `page-router` in the official documentation or standard usage. However, it seems you might be referring to the structure and routing mechanisms commonly used in Next.js applications. Let me provide you with information on how routing is typically managed in Next.js.

1. **Page Routing in Next.js:**
   - Next.js is primarily built around the concept of pages. Each file within the `pages` directory automatically becomes a route in your Next.js application.
   - For example, a file named `about.js` inside the `pages` directory will be accessible at the route `/about`.
   - Page-based routing is implicit and automatically handled by Next.js based on the file structure.

   ```jsx
   // pages/about.js
   const About = () => {
     return <div>About Page</div>;
   };

   export default About;
   ```

   In this example, visiting `/about` in your application will render the content of the `About` component.

2. **Custom Routing Using Next.js Router:**
   - Next.js also provides a client-side routing mechanism through the `next/router` package. This allows for programmatic navigation within your components.
   - This type of routing is typically used for more dynamic navigation based on user interactions or other events.

   ```jsx
   // pages/index.js
   import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

   const Home = () => {
     const router = useRouter();

     const handleClick = () => {
       router.push('/about');
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Home Page</p>
         <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About</button>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Home;
   ```

   In this example, clicking the "Go to About" button will navigate to the `/about` page using the Next.js router.

If you have specific use cases or other libraries in mind when mentioning `app-router` or `page-router`, please provide more context so I can offer more targeted information.
