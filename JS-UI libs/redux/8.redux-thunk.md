comp responsible for fetching data via action creator
1. component gets rendered
2. componentDidMount is called, which calls action creator

action creator make api call (here, we use redux-thunk)
3. action creator makes an API request
4. aPI response

we get fetched data into a compo by generating new state in redux store, then getting that into our comp via mapStateToProps
5. action creator returns actino with fetched data on payload property
6. some reducer sees the action, returns the data oof the payload
because we generated some new state object, redux/react-redux causes our react app to be re-rendered.

// 

action creators must return plain JS objects with a type property.  if you want to use an async action here, use middleware.

// 

this.props.fetchPosts()

is the same as

store.dispatch(fecthPosts

)

to change state, we call an action creator
which produces an action
which gets fed to a dispatch
(which forwards action to middleware)
which forwards the action to reducers
which creates new state

--
synchronous action creature - instantly returns an action

async action crator
takes some time for it to go
this requires middleware redux-thunk

middleware - in redux
plain function that calls with every action we dispatch
has ability to stop, modify, or mess around with action
tons of open source middlware exist - mostly dealiing with async actions

normal rules for action creatiors
1. ac must return an action object
2. must have a type propery

redux-thunk will relax rules around ao
it's an allpupose action creator
it allows ac to return action object OR a function
it will auto call this function for us. 

redux-thunk
if recieves an object, then it passes it to reducers
if a function, then it invokes function, passing into it dispatch and getstate functions as arguments





Extra - 

middleware will go between

1. dispatch
2. 


it is a play js function called with each action dispatch

it can 

1. stop action
2. modify action
3. some other function, like console.log

redux-thunk the best one.

action creators must

- reuturn action objects
- have a type 
- maybe have a payload

redux thunk relaxes rules around action creator

you can return either an action object or function
-if a function, it will call it for you. 

redux thunk takes an object or function

if object, then it passes it on to the store

if its a function, it invokes the function and passes in the getState and dispatch functions

when response api comes int, we manually dispatch action

this becomes a new action - a plain object

the object goes to dispatch wshich sends it to redux

redux will auto send it to the reducer. 

---------------

this doesn't work - 
export const fetchPosts = async() => {
  const response = await jsonPlaceholder.get('/posts');
  return { 
    type: 'FETCH_POSTS', 
    payload: response
  }
}

this works, but too slow since we will need info - 
call action creator and call reducers happens too fast... 

export const fetchPosts = () => {
  const promise = jsonPlaceholder.get('/posts');
  return { 
    type: 'FETCH_POSTS', 
    payload: promise
  }
}


we need middleware to slow things down.. 
synchronous action creators - immeidately returns n action with data ready to go
async action creator - requires time before it can dispatch 

middle ware allows us to deal with this.
---------


in src/index.js

import {createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

const store = createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk));
.... <Provider store={store}>

in our api

// we don't return action, but a function with action in it
// return to async await
// we define a function that returns a function
export const fetchPosts = () => 
async dispatch => 
  const response = await jsonPlaceholder.get('/posts');



dispatch({type: 'FETCH_POSTS', payload: response})
