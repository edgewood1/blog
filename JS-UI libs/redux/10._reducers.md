 **CREATE THE REDUCER pt2.**

- the reducer is the store interface
- based on action type, it will modify and return a new state

TWO PARTS

1. create the initial state
2. create the initial reducer that returns state
3. export reducer to index.js/store, which passes it into the createStore() function.
4. the reducer and the store are coupled


 ```javascript
 // 1. create the inital default state
const initState = { todo: [], posts: []}

// 2. create initial reducer

const reduce = (state = initState, action) => {
  return state
}

// 3. export
export default reduce; // or myreducer

 ```

__EXAMPLE THREE__

```js
import {combineReducers} from 'redux';
// reducers
const songsReducer = () => {
  return [
    {title: 'No Scrubs', duration: '4:05'},
    {title: 'All Star', duration: '3:33'},
    {title: 'Macarena', duration: '3:33'},
    {title: 'I want it that way', duration: '1:45'}
  ]
}

const selectedSongReducer = (selectedSong = null, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'SONG_SELECTED') {
    return action.payload;
  }
  return selectedSong;
}

export default combineReducers({
  songs: songsReducer, 
  selectedSong: selectedSongReducer
})
```

__EXPANDING THE REDUCER__

1. SPREADS 

the reducer overwrites the state using spread.
- take a spread of the current state,
- add the new array to this. 
- return as an object of arrays  
  
```javascript
  if (action.type == "addToDo") {
    return {
      ...state, 
      todos: [...state.todos, action.todo]
      }
  }
```
This spreads all the item in the previous state while the `todos` array overwrites the previous `todos` with this particular array.

__EXAMPLE TWO__

a reducer is a if-then statement
if action.type is delete, then return a state minus item to delete. 

```javascript
const reducer = (state = init, action) {
  if (action.type==="delete") {
    let newPosts = state.posts.filter(post => {
      return action.id !== post.id
    })
    return {
      ...state, 
      posts: newPosts
    }
  }
  return state
}
```

__EXAMPLE FOUR__ USING switch/case in one function


```javascript

// create default state
const INITIAL_STATE = {
  wines: []
};

// reducer with TWO possibilities: 

const reducer = (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) => {

  // if action.type = "NEW_YEAR... 
  switch (action.type) {
  case 'NEW_YEAR':
    const newPosts = action.payload[0].filter(wine => {
      return wine.vintage === action.payload[1];
    });
    return Object.assign({}, state, {
      wines: newPosts
    });

  // if action.type = 'FETCH_WINES... '
  case 'FETCH_WINES_SUCCESS':
    return Object.assign({}, state, {
      wines: action.payload.wines
    });
  default:
    return state;
  }
};
```

Advanced Reducers

cycle

1. action creator (fetchPosts)
2. yields an action object
3. sent to the reducer postsReducer in store

rules of reducers

1. must return any value besides undefined
2. reducers should produce / erturn state that will be used in our app using only prious state adn the action.
   -- the first time reducer is called, the state is undefined
   -- the next time, the passed in state is what was last sent out
3. pure function - must not reach outside of itself to figure out what rule to return
   -- if we call reducer, we should reach out of function to make an api request, or grabbing input from the front end, instead, we only return a computation done on an incoming argument - return a variation of state+action arguments, like for /filter

 4. must not mutate input state

 - mutation - changing content to an array - adding, removing, changing elements
 - strings and numbers are immutable
 - you can mutate the state argument, but there's an exception - returning state causes ? 
 - how to work with state without changing  array / object

  1. remove - state.filter(e => e!== 'hi')
  2. add - [...state, 'hi'] // spread
  3. replace - state.map(el=> el==='hi' ? 'bye' : el)
     object
  4. update - {...state, name: 'Sam'}
  5. add = {...state, age: 30}
  6. remove {...state, age: undefined} or _.omit(state: 'age')

 spreads - filters - map
 this creates a new array, so doesn't alter the new array
