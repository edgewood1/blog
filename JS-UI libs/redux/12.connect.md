// how to call a function that dispatches? 

```js
import {selectSong} from '../actions';

export default connect(mapStateToProps, {selectSong: selectSong} )(SongList);
```
connect passes in
1. mapStateToProps AND action creators to be used
2. the name of the component

NOW, the action creator functions become part of our props, and we can use them to pass in song details. 

```js
<Button onClick={()=> this.props.selectSong(song)} >
  Select
</Button>
```

we don't directly call our creator function in our component


redux doesn't auto detect action creators being called
it doesn't detect a function returning an object that is an action

so we have to wire/register the action creator with redux

through connect(), we're able to do this.

connect() dispatches the action to redux store, so we don't have to write store.dispatch()

// pass in to connect:
// above function gives us access to state
// also the action creator object
// connect passes these into store.dispatch

state has all the properties, but we only map 1
