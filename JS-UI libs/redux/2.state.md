Main terms

* action - an object with `type` property and `payload`; used to change state

* action creator - a function that returns an action

* dispatch - a store method used to pass an action to store

* reducer - a function that recieves dispatch and changes the state / uses action + old state to return new state

  

  

* subscribe - a store method that updates us on the state change

**State** -

- data structure with values used by the whole application.  
- it lacks setters so that we can't accidentally make changes. 
- the data object maintained by the store

```
state = { name: 'mel', age: 5 }
```

If we want to change state, we "dispatch an action".  

**Reducer** - this ties the state to an action.  Its a function that takes state and action as arguments and returns the next state of the app.  It consists of a switch statemetn that goes through all possible action types.  It takes two parameters

- action
- State

```
const initialState = {
  todos: [
    { id: 1, text: 'Eat' },
    { id: 2, text: 'Sleep' },
  ],
  loading: false,
  hasErrors: false,
}

function todoReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case DELETE_TODO:
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: state.todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.payload),
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

```

 

store - a container that the state lives.  The store is initialized with a reducer.  In React, a <Provider> has access to this store, so that if we wrap 

\']our app inside it, we can access store



 

```
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import reducer from './reducers'

const store = createStore(reducer)

render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
