const {
  createSelector
} = Reselect;

1. create your functions, which will accept state, and filter out for future calling.

const shopItemsSelector = state => state.shop.items
const taxPercentSelector = state => state.shop.taxPercent
const name = state => state.shop.name

const subtotalSelector = createSelector(
  shopItemsSelector,
  items => items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0)
)

const mosh = createSelector(
  name, 
  shopItemsSelector, 
  (a, z) => a+z[0].name
)

const taxSelector = createSelector(
  subtotalSelector,
  taxPercentSelector,
  (subtotal, taxPercent) => subtotal * (taxPercent / 100)
)

const totalSelector = createSelector(
  subtotalSelector,
  taxSelector,
  (subtotal, tax) => ({ total: subtotal + tax })
)

let exampleState = {
  shop: {
    taxPercent: 8,
    name: "mel",
    items: [
      { name: 'apple', value: 1.20 },
      { name: 'orange', value: 0.95 },
    ]
  }
}

console.log(subtotalSelector(exampleState)) // 2.15
console.log(taxSelector(exampleState))      // 0.172
console.log(totalSelector(exampleState))    // { total: 2.322 }
console.log(mosh(exampleState))  // melapple

in my example, you create a selector that will return a computed value
then you call the selector, passing in the state, to get that value.
