**Redux**

- a state container for managing global state + track changes with Redux DevTools.  Smaller applications should use Context API instead.
- a pattern and library for managing and updating state, using events called "actions". 
- a centralized store for state that can be used across the app
- helps you manage global state

Redux is a standalone JS library, but it is used with other packages: 

- React-redux ~ integrates with any UI, but mostly React
- Redux-Toolkit - a wrapper around redux with best practices built in
- redux DevTols extension - shows a history of changes



redux toolkit wraps around redux core, building in suggested practices.
