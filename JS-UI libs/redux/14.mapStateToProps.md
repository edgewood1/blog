COMPONENT

connect is a function, which we invoke to get a higher order component.  so we invoke first, then we pass in Home to the function it returns

```javascript
import {connect} from 'react-redux';

class Home extends Component {
...
}

export default connect()(Home)
```

passes store/state to `this.props`  
state current consists of many properties - 
just get the one you need
for this component, we want to return only the 'posts' property to props 
pass mapState into connect so it can interact with it

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    posts:state.posts
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Home)
```

-------------------------------STOP

or `ownProps` refers to props before state gotten from store.  it will have match (with info on route parameters).  

this below will cycle through props and look for id of each one.. .find() is like a filter except??

This id is the? 

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
  let id = ownProps.match.params.post_id

  return {
    posts:state.posts.find(post => post.id ===id)
  }
}
```
