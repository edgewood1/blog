Environment

The collection of variables and their values that exist at a given time

When a program starts up, this environment is not empty. It always contains variables that are part of the language standard, and most of the time, it has variables that provide ways to interact with the surrounding system. For example, in a browser, there are variables and functions to inspect and influence the currently loaded website and to read mouse and keyboard input.
