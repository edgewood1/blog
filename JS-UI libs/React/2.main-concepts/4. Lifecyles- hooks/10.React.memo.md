`React.memo`

const ChildComp = () => ....

const MemoChild = React.memo(ChildComp)

in parent use <MemoChild>

Parent contains: 
- own state
- a child component

When state changes, and parent re-renders as a result, it auto-renders the child as well, even if the child has not changed.

`useCallback`

Parent maintains
- state for itself and child
- handleClick for itself and child

if parent button fires parent handleclick, it will cause the child to render, even if child has not changed - even with React.memo
This is because React.memo can't handle methods - 

`useMemo`

same as above, but handles objects

could also handle exensive calculations, so if you don't
