- problem
This template uses the variable `hi` that is the result of a slow function call.
It runs with each render.
When you click `slow` it runs intentionally.
However, when you click `fast`, it runs because `fast` changes the `task` state, 
which causes a render, and `hi` is recalcuate with each render. 

To fix
wrap the value of `hi` in a `React.memo` so that it only runs if `count` has changed.
if on a new render, `count` has not changed, then it will use the previous value

memoization is the caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.


```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const [task, setTask] = React.useState(0);
  const addCount = (x) => {
    setCount(x + 1);
  };

  const test = (x) => {
    setTask(x + 1);
  };

  const slowCalculation = (num) => {
    console.log('Calculating...');
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
      num += 1;
    }
    return num;
  };

  const hi = slowCalculation(count)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{hi}</div>
      <div>{task} </div>
      <button onClick={() => test(task)}> fast </button>
      <button onClick={() => addCount(count)}> slow </button>
    </div>
  );
}
  ```

whenever template re-renders, this function fired. 

But what if template rerenders, and the values inputted to the call are the same? 
that is, template renders NOT because ofchange in count but because change in todo? 

when 

On rerender, every function is recreated, so setcount + setTodos 

It would run one every re-render, even if unnecessary.

useMemo says only re-create this new variable if its input has changed
