**hooks**

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.  They enables you use state and other react features without writing ES6 classes.

- Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.
- must be called inside a react function

**There are 2 kinds:**

- Built-in: useState, etc
- Custom: You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components

**Six Kinds of built-in hooks**

**(1) State hooks** allow us to remember info between renders.  Two kinds: 

- [`useState`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useState) declares a state variable that you can update directly.
- [`useReducer`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useReducer) declares a state variable with the update logic inside a [reducer function.](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)



**(2) Context hooks** - reads and subscribes to a context, regardless of how far. 

- useContext



**(3) Ref Hooks** - stores info not used for rendering, like a DOM NODE or timeout ID.  When updating, the component doesn't re-render.  

- [`useRef`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useRef) declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node.
- [`useImperativeHandle`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useImperativeHandle) lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used.

```
function Form() {

  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  // ...
```

**(4) Effect Hook** - lets component connect to external systems: network, browser DOM, animations, widgets (any non-react code)

- [`useEffect`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useEffect) connects a component to an external system.

```
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {

  useEffect(() => {

    const connection = createConnection(roomId);

    connection.connect();

    return () => connection.disconnect();

  }, [roomId]);
```

There are two variations of `useEffect` with differences in timing:

- [`useLayoutEffect`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useLayoutEffect) fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.
- [`useInsertionEffect`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useInsertionEffect) fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.

**(5) Performance Hooks** allows us to skip unnecessary work (such as calculations or unneeded rerenderings).

- [`useMemo`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useMemo) lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
- [`useCallback`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useCallback) lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.

**(6) Other Hooks** 

These Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code.

- [`useDebugValue`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useDebugValue) lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook.
- [`useId`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useId) lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.
- [`useSyncExternalStore`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useSyncExternalStore) lets a component subscribe to an external store.
