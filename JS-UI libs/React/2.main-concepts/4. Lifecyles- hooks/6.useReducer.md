useReducer

- An alternative to useState 
- accepts a reducer of type: (state, action) => newState;
- returns current state paired with a dispatch method

Example

- reducer - a function that

```jsx
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
  // ...
```

part 1: reducer

- params: state, action
  - state passed in 
- return a new state object based on the old

```
function reducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'incremented_age') {
    return {
      age: state.age + 1
    };
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action.');
}
```

part 2 pass reducer into hook, along with initalState.  

returns: 

- current state
- dispatch function that takes an action object

Params: 

- reducer function (above)
- inital state

```
export default function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
```

part3: dispatch action

      <button onClick={() => {
        dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' })
      }}>
