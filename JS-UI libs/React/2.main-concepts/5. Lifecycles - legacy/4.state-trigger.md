**State is an object**

State is an object that is private to & fully controlled by the component.  

It is usually placed between the class declaration and render method:


```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
    state = {
        count: 1,
        address: {
            street: ""
        }
    };
    ...render goes here.. 
```

- in render(), refer to state via the *this* keyword in curly braces.  
- In JSX, curly braces enable **Javascript expressions** and are NOT used for the bodies of methods, objects, and classes in ES6, so..d

Render State:

```jsx
render() {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <span> {this.state.count} </span>
            <button>Increment</button>
        </React.Fragment>
    )
};
```

Instead of display state directly, we can run it t hrough a "getter"

```javascript
  formatCount() {
    const { count } = this.state;
    return count === 0 
        ? "Begin Game" : count;
  }
```

OR use a tag rather than the "Begin Game" string

```javascript
return count === 0 ? <h1>Zero</h1> : count;
```

Revise span:

```javascript
<span> {this.formatCount()} </span>
```
