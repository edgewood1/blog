**MOUNT**: component is connected to the DOM

<hr></hr>

**Before Connect**

Constructor (before – computerWillMount)

- ONLY runs ONCE, initializing the sate
- use super(props) in order to access this.props
- bind methods (no longer needed due to es6 fat arrows)
- avoid copying props into state because we can use `this.props.x` instead and updates to the prop won’t be reflected in state. 
- avoid setState here
- https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#constructor



getDerivedStateFromProps (before: ComponentWillRecieveProps)

- update internal state from changes in props (runs for both mounting and update)
- If a child uses state, we can conditionally update it when props change AND parent re-rendered
- a static function and so has no access to  `this` 
- don't place callbacks here as this is not an instance-based lifecycle method. 
- Triggering state changes from here could cause loops(e.g. with redux calls).

  

```js
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    if (props.age > state.age) {
      return { age: props.age }   
    } 
}
```



**During Mount**

<hr></hr>

Render() 

– your component gets mounted onto the DOM, so we see it in the browser, along with: 

- child constructors
- child renders
- child componentDidMounts? 



**After Mount**

<hr></hr>

componentDidmount 

after render, we do the following:  

- api / ajax call / network requests 
- change state – this.setState, etc..  (causing render to run again!)
- setInterval to change timer, causing state to change in a different function
- subscribe, but unscubcribe in unmount
- prior to deprecation, *componentWillMount was once the place for setState.

? ComponentWillUpdate – same as compDidMount – set varaibles here. But don’t run setState here.

- get data from firebase
- also only runs once - when refresh page or delete and re-render component
