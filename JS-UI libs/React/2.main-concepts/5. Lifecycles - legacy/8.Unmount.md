<h4><span style="bold-weight:980">UNMOUNT</span></h4>

<hr></hr>

Element is removed / disconnected from DOM

**BEFORE** 

componentWillUnmount -     

- fires remove a component from the screen
- to this end, conditionally render components. 
- And finally, we have this single unmounting component.  
- This might be called after logout to delete info, etc // CLEAN UP



```jsx
componentWillUnmount() {
		console.log("comp did unmount");
  }

```
