**lifecycle methods**

__mounting__

constructor -initial state and data loading - api calls - one-time setups

getDerivedStateFromProps()

render - content visible on screen > only do JSX - : no requests, etc


componentDidMount - sit and wait for updates - these fire AFTER render - same as constructor - but better to do data loading here - api calls, etc... clarifies code. Like constuctor ONETIME.

__updating__


getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate - - sit and wait until component is not longer show - these fire AFTER update - called many, many times... after every re-render. every time a certain button is clicked and do data loading from this, then...



__unmounting__

componentWillUnmount - if we decide to stop showing component on the screen, this would fire. if used with non-react libraries... google maps?
