title:  Passing from Child to Parent

When the child state changes, we will: 
1. display the Child state
2. send to the Parent
3. have the Parent use it to change its own state
4. display this new Parent state

To begin, set the state in the Parent:  


```javascript
import React, {Component} from "react";
import Child from './child.jsx'

class Parent extends React.Component{
    state = { 
        clicks: 0
    }

```
Then, create a 'Parent interface ' method.

This will accept a value from the child and multiply it by 2.  

We will pass this function to the child so that the child can use it. 

```javascript
    setParent = (newCount) => {
        this.setState(
            {clicks: newCount*2} 
        )
    }
```

Give the childacces to the setState function // callback from parent

```javascript
    render() {
        return(
            <div>
                <Child setParent={this.setParent} />
                <p>In parent, multiplied by 2: 
                    {this.state.clicks}</p>
            </div>
        )
    }
};

export default Parent;

```

Child has its own state


```javascript
class Child extends React.Component {
    state = {
        click: 0
    }
```
In Child, set state takes: 

- an object: 

- a function that calls the parent setState. 

```javascript
handleClick = () => {
  this.setState({
    click: this.state.click+1
  }, () => {
    this.props.setParent(this.state.click);
  })  
}
```
Here, we render our button.  When it is pressed, it calls our Child interface, and displays the results. 

```javascript
render() {
  return(
    <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
    {this.state.click}
</button>
...
}
```
