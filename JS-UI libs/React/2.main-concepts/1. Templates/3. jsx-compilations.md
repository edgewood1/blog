JSX requires a React object
Both of them are compiled by bable into vanilla js
webpack puts these pieces together into a build
babel? uses a react preloader to help turn these pieces into vanilla?

JSX is not required.  It is just "syntactic sugar" for:  
- calling createElement()
- this is DOM method Method.  

__Using vanilla JS__

```js
var div = document.createElement('div');
div.textContent = "hello world";
div.setAttribute('class', 'yellow');
document.body.appendChild(div);
```

__Using JSX__

```js
import { React } from React
const title = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'hello world');
// see Footnote for more info
```

__Both render:__ 

```javascript
<div class="yellow">hello world</div>.
```

__Example 2__

1. JSX

const hello = <h1 className = "greet"> Hello World </h1>

2. Compiles to this, via the React object: 

const hello = React.createElement {
    type: "h1",
    props: {
        className: "greet",  
        children: "Hello World" 
        }
    }

3. Compiles to the longer `document.create..`  vanilla JS example


__Footnote__

There are three arguments above: 
1. element type: if its an HTML element, we use a string "<h1>" else if a Component, we pass in the variable the component is assigned to.
2. object containing props to be passed to component.  a className attribute might appear in this object.  
3. children of this component - a string would become text content; a reference to another element or component would appear nested inside of this one.  We could even add multiple in an array form.
