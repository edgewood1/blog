__HTML + JS__

This needs to be parent:
```html
    <div id = "app"></div>
```

```js
import Parent from "./components/parent";
ReactDOM.render(<Parent />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

__React - Behind the scenes:__

1. React calls the Parent component (if we had passed an arg, like below...) with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.
2. Our Welcome component returns a <h1>Hello, Sara</h1> element as the result.
3. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match <h1>Hello, Sara</h1>.

__ReactDOM.render__

The render method consists of two arguments
1. The component to render (<Parent />)
2. The root element on which to render (doc...)

**React's templating library is ReactDOM**

ReactDOM - a library that provides DOM-specific methods to be used at the top level of your app or as an escape hach to get outside of the React model if you need to .  

```js
ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])
```

- renders an element into the DOM supplied container
- the render() method appends JSX to an HTML node.  
- .render(JSX code, node to attach it to)



__Define component__

```jsx
const Element = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
```

__Two ways to render:__

1. render function
```js
ReactDOM.render(<Element name="Amy" />, document.getElementById('app'));
```
2. use in another component as a tag

```jsx
< Element name="Amy" />

```
3. as a vanilla JS function - but this cannot take advantage of lifecycles, hooks, etc.

```jsx
// call function
render(Welcome('Sara'), document.getElementById('root'));
```

The component's JSX attributes and children are passed to the props object.

__Lit__
 
passing arguments

```js
const element = (name) => html`<h1>Hello, ${name} </h1>`;
render(element('Amy'), document.getElementById('app'));
```

- we couldn't pass this to another component, and then use it as a tag because custom element tags must be registered with DOM.
