__There are two ways of creating a component:__ 

1. a JS function: 

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```



__How to render either approach: <Welcome/>__ 


```js
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
export default element;
```
This could be reimagined as:

1. Function:

const element = Welcome("Sara")

2. Class

const welcome = new Welcome()
welcome.render(Sara) ... 

React.Component would accept this argument and pass it to this.prop.name

* Note: Typically, we wouldn't pass "Sara" in, but set "Sara" in the components state, and change this state via 'setState'
