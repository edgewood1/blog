**Lit's templating library is called HTML**

- this returns a template string:
- it uses a js function (rather than a jsx one)
- this would work with vanilla js


**What templates make easier:** 

string literal - a quoted series of characters

string interpolation - evaluating a [string literal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal) containing one or more [placeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_(document)#Placeholders), yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values.
