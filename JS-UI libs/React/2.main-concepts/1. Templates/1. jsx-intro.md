__What does React do?__

- createElement: this will create a vanilla JS DOM expression

**What does this render? JSX**

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript.

It is used to write React "elements", which are rendered to the DOM. 

It must be converted to vanilla javascript via Babel.  

JSX is different from HTML in that it can use JS variables.  It also uses different styling and class name formats.  

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
