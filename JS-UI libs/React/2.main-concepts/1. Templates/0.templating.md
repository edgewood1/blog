**What is templating?** 

- a client-side data-binding technique.  
- integrates html with text content, attribute values, that are bound to js properties
- also allows for js expressions
- these expressions and values often occur within special characters, like double curly brackets (i.e. {{key}}) to call values of the given key from data files, often JSON objects.
- one-way binding: if a property changes the template equivalent changes
- two-way binding: if template value changes, so does the property.
