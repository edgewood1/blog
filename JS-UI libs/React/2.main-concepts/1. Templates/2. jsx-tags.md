Two ways of creating tags:

1. A self-closing tag: 

<div className="sidebar" />

- also known as a void element contains no child elements or text node.  

- one whose tagName is capitalized = a component: 
- We don't call a React component as if it were a regular function; instead, we call it by enclosing it in self-closing tags.  These tags can also take attributes as parameters.
```js
ReactDOM.render(<Parent />, ...
```

2. A regular component tag: 

```js
<Child key={counter.id}>
    <h4> Title </h4>
</Child>
```
