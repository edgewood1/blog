**Terms**

Row − A row (= tuple, entry or record) is a group of related data, for example the data of one subscription.

Redundancy − Storing data twice, redundantly to make the system faster.

Primary Key − A primary key is unique. A key value can not occur twice in one table. With a key, you can only find one row.

Foreign Key − A foreign key is the linking pin between two tables.

Compound Key − A compound key (composite key) is a key that consists of multiple columns, because one column is not sufficiently unique.

Index − An index in a database resembles an index at the back of a book.

Referential Integrity − Referential Integrity makes sure that a foreign key value always points to an existing row.
