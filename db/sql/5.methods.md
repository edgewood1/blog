Orderby

ORDERBY - sort records in ascending (the default) or descending order. 

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

This will print descending order for two columns - by country in descending, and within country, by contactName: 

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country DESC, ContactName DESC;

If you reverse contactname and country, then it will only order by contactname since they don't repeat and thus don't allow Country a space to be ordered. 


IS NOT NULL - check if select columns is not null; IS NULL does the same for null values. 

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Address FROM Persons
WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;


select statements
sum(column) as mel from grid where


WHERE
  -- demand_loss_mw should not contain NULL values
  demand_loss_mw IS NOT null and
  -- nerc_region should be 'MRO';
  nerc_region = 'MRO';

COUNT (* - all columns)
all - select count(*) from people; - counts rows
all - select count(column) from people; - counts only if data is present
only distinct - select count(distinct birthdate) from people; counts only unqiue appearances
