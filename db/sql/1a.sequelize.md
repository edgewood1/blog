**Third party apps**

```
npm install express sequelize mysql2 cors --save
```

express - backend framework
sequelize - ORM
mysql2 - mysql driver; install manual driver for your database of choice; sequelize provides ORM features only, but NOT BUILT-IN DATABASE DRIVERS
cors - 

**Note:** Since this tutorial uses MySQL as the database, you are using a driver for that. Depending on your database, you can manually install the driver like so:

- `npm install --save pg pg-hstore # Postgres`
- `npm install --save mysql2`
- `npm install --save mariadb`
- `npm install --save sqlite3`
- `npm install --save tedious # Microsoft SQL Server`
