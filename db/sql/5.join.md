my $sql = qq(SELECT e.ticketNumber, e.escLevel, h.uso_order_number, h.path_id FROM escalations AS e LEFT JOIN halo_orders AS h ON e.ticketNumber = h.service_order_number WHERE e.ticketNumber = ? AND h.uso_order_number = ? AND e.ticketTypeID = '6' ORDER BY escalationDateTime DESC LIMIT 1);

what is "e"? 

The keyword AS is used to assign an alias to the column or a table. It is inserted between the column name and the column alias or between the table name and the table alias. 

if two tables have columns with the same headers, you can "join" them.  


read region in a1 and sales in a2
from a1 join a2
on a1.store = a2.store
group by a1.region

yr interested in comparing 2 cols, but they are in 2 different tables
from / join will combine these tables
identify the two common tables 
organize by a specific column

SELECT A1.Region_Name REGION, SUM(A2.Sales) SALES
FROM Geography A1
JOIN Store_Information A2
ON A1.Store_Name = A2.Store_Name
GROUP BY A1.Region_Name; 

SELECT A1.name, A2.cust_name
FROM salesman A1
JOIN customer A2
ON A1.city = A2.city
GROUP BY A1.city

INTERPRETATION - 
SELECT 4 columns
from 1 table 
AS 



we two different databases - 
local used by uat and dev
non-local w/ real ticket numbers / issues used by prod.  so i think i need access to this.
