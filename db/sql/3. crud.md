__ROWS: Crud__



__CREATE__

INSERT INTO table_name ( field1, field2,...fieldN )
   VALUES
   ( value1, value2,...valueN );

 INSERT INTO `a_users`(mobile_setting) VALUES (null);

into specific columns

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

essentially adding a new row: 

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

__READ__

SELECT * FROM table_name;

This returns all values under the included columns: 

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

This returns the same as above, but will not return duplicate values
so if you choose the "country" column and there are two rows that have "Mexico" in this column, 
then it will only return one of these rows: 

SELECT DISTINCT col1
FROM table_nameV

This allows you to extract only those records that fit your specific condition: 

SELECT col1
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example of a condition: 

Country='Mexico';

AND, NOT, OR operators

SELECT col1
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3;

This will return all the columns  that meet the conditions qualified by the WHERE statement:

SELECT * FROM [Orders] WHERE EmployeeID=4 AND ShipperID=1 OR ShipperID=3;

__UPDATE__

UPDATE *table_name*
SET *column1* = *value1*, *column2* = *value2*, ...
WHERE *condition*;

UPDATE `cs`.`a_users` SET `mobile_setting` = 'null' WHERE (`pk` = '2');




__DELETE__

DELETE FROM - removes the row that contains the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:

Example
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
