prototype 

- prototype is a property of a Function object. 
- It is the prototype of objects constructed by that function.  thus, an internal property in js objects
- points to the object from which it inherits
- the way objects inherit features from other objects



What is **proto**?

- an accessor property of Object.prototype - exposing prototype via linkage.  It exposes [[Prototype]]
-   __proto__ is internal property of an object, pointing to its prototype. Current standards provide an equivalent Object.getPrototypeOf(O) method, though de facto standard __proto__ is quicker.


-  points to Object.prototype.  We can access all of its methods… 
- A function MUST have a prototype to act as a constructor.  this does not: `var mel = {}``
- ``prototype` builds `__proto__` in the instance
- `__proto__` is an object used in lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. 
- `__proto__` points to `[[prototype]]`  - ie instance.__proto__ === constructor.prototype

```js
( new Foo ).__proto__ === Foo.prototype; // new uses __proto__
```
instance has no prototype itself:
```js
( new Foo ).prototype === undefined;  // it doesn't use the actual
```

![proto__ VS. prototype in JavaScript - Stack Overflow](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGfN3.png)

1. Constructor Function Foo 
   - it contains prototype object
   - it points back to Function.prototype
   - Function.prototype.__proto__ points back to Object.prototype 

2. CF Foo contains a prototype object 
  - links back to Function, Object, a constructor
  - constains: 
    - constructor - it points back to its parent function.  in teh case of a constructor function, the constructor would be Object? Function?  It does this via __proto__ ?  
    - about constructor: - This is a property carries “own” properties that will appear in each instance - Own properties have values / states that are unique to each instance. Ie, newCar.constructor === Car // true
    - properties and methods user-enabled
      

3. New instances
   1. contain property
   2. `__proto__` points back to `Foo.prototype.  (see @2)

 **Instances with new**

```js
function Foo (name) { this.name = name; }
var newFoo = new Foo ('JavaScript');
console.log(newFoo)
```
This maintains linkage with Foo
```
{ name: ‘mel’, __proto__: Foo }
```

Aka: compare this way to what’s below

- set [[Prototype]] to the prototype of Foo
- call this prototype, setting its `this` to the new object.
- give the new object a property that can be refered to

```
var o = new Object(); 
o.[[Prototype]] = Foo.prototype; Foo.call(o);
```

**What’s another way of seeing this process**

```js
function a(name) { 
  this.name = name; 
  return this; 
}

let b = {};

b = a.call(b, 'mel') // {name: "mel"}e.prototype = a.prototype
```



**Compare what we just saw to this:** 

```js
var o = new Foo(); // JavaScript actually just does
var o = new Object(); 
o.[[Prototype]] = Foo.prototype; 
Foo.call(o);

```

**Steps**

- create an object
- set its __proto__ to F.prototype
- intialize instance
- call F with arguments passed and this set to instance
- return instance

```js
var x = { __proto__ = f.prototype}
jar.name = "jay";
```


**Prototyical chain ~ These are true:** 
// constructor function

```js
function Point(x, y) {  
  this.x = x;  
  this.y = y;
}
var myPoint = new Point();
```

**the following are all true**

myPoint.__proto__ == Point.prototype

myPoint.__proto__.__proto__ == Object.prototype

myPoint instanceof Point;
myPoint instanceof Object;

myPoint.__proto__.constructor.prototype == Point.prototype
