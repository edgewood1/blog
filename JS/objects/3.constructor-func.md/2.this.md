__#2: keyword 'this'__
================================================

`this` refers to the object from which the function is executed.
here, `this` refers to `user1` then `user2`

```js
function print(word) {
  this.word = word;
  return this  // this = window... not effective
}
```

Instead, create an object, copy the function to it, and then run it off the function, that way, `this` has a simpler referent: the `b` object: 

```js
var b = {}
b.print = print;
b.print('mel')
console.log(print) // print isn't affected by the command
console.log(b) // b now has a new property 'word'
```

Try embedding it in an object: 

```js
var a = {
  print(a) { this.name = a; }
}
```

An alternative way of writing this: 

```js
var a = { print: function(a) {this.name = a}}
```

This creates an object property on `a` called 'name'

```js
var b = a.print('mel') 

console.log(a.name)  // mel

console.log(b) // nothing is returned, to return you need: 
```

Try this, but even then, only a string is returned, so b is not an object like a -- you've just returned a value. 

```js
var a = {
  print(a) { this.name = a; return this.name }
}

console.log(typeof b) // string
```

to make b like a, try this - but this only returns an object with the name property - not the print method... 

```js
var a = {print(a) {this.name = a; return {name: a}}}
```

or this returns all - it essentially duplicates object in memory

```js
var a = {print(a) {this.name = a; return this}} // 
```
