**Constructor Function**

- defines properties whose values will be unique for each object. - each object has its own properties. 
- so name is not on the prototype object
- functions written with the idea of creating objects via new
- they typically contain `this` , a reference to the object from which function called  (its execution context)

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name
}
```
**It also resolves into an object**

```js
ƒ Person(name)
name: "Person" // constructor name
prototype: {constructor: ƒ}  // object open to instances - it contains:
    constructor: ƒ Person(name) // Points Back to function that created it
    [[Prototype]]: Object //  Since Prototype is an object, we have a reference to Object
[[FunctionLocation]]: VM110:1
[[Prototype]]: ƒ ()  // Since Person is a function, we have access to Function
```

**properties of a constructor function**

- contains 3 peroperties
  - name ~ Jay
  - prototype ~ an object with 2 properties
    - Constructor - a link to function jay
    - [[Prototype]] - a link to Object
  - [[Protoype]] - a link to function Object



 **Constructor property**

-  function that creates an object istnce.  
-  gets called when we use `new` keyword on a function.  

```
f a() {
  prototype: {
    constructor: f a(),
    hello: f() // this is a custom method attached to prototype
  }
}
```

**What can we do with the protytpe?** 

```
- constructor // this is a link to the constructor function
- hasOwnProperty: 
- isPrototypeOf: 
- propertyIsEnumerable
- toLocaleString
- toString
- valueof
- getProtottypeOf
- proto
- getOwnPropertyNames(func.prototype)
```

**Adding a method to prototype, so its a shared function**

```js
Person.prototype.showName = function() {
  console.log(this.name)
}
```

Resolves to:

```js
prototype: {constructor: ƒ}  
    showName: f(); // diagram shows a method called 'describe'
    constructor: ƒ Person(name) // Points back to constructor function that made it
    [[Prototype]]: Object // since prototype is an object, we have this reference
```



 **Three ways of adding a property**

1. the prototype (allows each instance to refer to same copy

```
a.prototype = function() { etc }
```

Looks like

```
f a() {
  prototype: {
    constructor: f a(),
    hello: f() // this is a custom method attached to prototype
  }
}
```

2. adding a method to the constructor function // this will be copied to each object (memory waste)

```js
function a(name) { 
  this.name = name; 
  this.show = function() {
    console.log(this.name)
  }}
 
```

each instance will get a copy of both prop and method.

```js
name: "joh"   // instance level
show: ƒ ()   // instance level
[[Prototype]]: Object     // prototype
  constructor: ƒ a(name)  // prototype
  [[Prototype]]: Object   // proto-prototype
```

3. object itself

```
a.x = 5
```



__Creating Instances (objects)__

```js
const jon = new Person('jon')
```

Resolves to:

```
Person {name: "jon"}

name: "jon"
[[Prototype]]: Refers back to Person.prototype, copied below
  showName: ƒ () // via prototype, it has access to this function 
  constructor: ƒ Person(name) // it has access to the function that created it
  [[Prototype]]: Object  // since prototype is an object, we have a reference to Object
```
