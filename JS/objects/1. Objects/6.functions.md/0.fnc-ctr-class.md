**function**

```js
function a () {
	const a = 'hello';
	console.log(a);
}
```

**ES5 constructor: function**

```js
function ab() {
	this.a = 'hello';
	console.log(this.a)
}
ab.prototype.hello() {
	console.log('hello')
}
```

**ES6 constructor: class**

```js
class ac {
  constructor() {
    this.a = 'hello';
  }
  get hello() {
  	return this.a
  }
}
```
alternative syntax
```js
class Ac {
  method = () => {}
}
```

is just syntactic sugar for creating an instance method in the class constructor:

```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    this.method = () => {}
  }
}
console.log(new A().method === A.prototype.method); // true
```

invocations: regular / constructor

1. acts like a regular function

```js
ab() // this: window > logs `hello`
```

2. creates an object with keyword `new`

```js
const bb = new ab();
console.log(bb) // {a: hello}
```

__Discussion on Alternative syntax__
 

Note: This syntax is not an official part of the JavaScript language yet ([currently in stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields)) so you must use a [transpiler like Babel to handle it](https://babeljs.io/repl#?babili=false&browsers=&build=&builtIns=false&code_lz=MYGwhgzhAECC0G8BQ1oFsCmAXAFgewBNoBeaACgEoSA-RAX2iTqA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&lineWrap=true&presets=stage-2&prettier=false&targets=&version=6.26.0&envVersion=).

The value of `this` within `method` is the class `A` because that is what `this` points to in the constructor (since [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) inherit the context from the scope they are defined in):



```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    this.method = () => this;
  }
}

const instance = new A();
console.log(instance.method() === instance); // true
```

Defining a regular (non-arrow function) method on the class creates a method on the class prototype (not instance) but sets no rules on what `this` will be (since `this` is dynamic in JS and [depends on how a function is called, not how it's defined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)).

 
If methods defined in either of these ways are called on the class instance (via the `.`), as per the rule of how `this` is bound when a function is called as a method of an object, `this` will point to the class instance in both cases:



```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    this.methodOnInstance = () => this;
  }
  methodOnPrototype() { return this; }
}

const instance = new A();
console.log(
  instance.methodOnInstance() === instance.methodOnPrototype(), // true
  instance.methodOnPrototype() === instance // true
);
```

One major difference between the two method declarations above is that the instance method has `this` **always** fixed to the class instance while the class (prototype) method does not (we can change it by using [Function.prototype.apply](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) or [Function.prototype.call](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call))



```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    this.methodOnInstance = () => this;
  }
  methodOnPrototype() { return this; }
}

const instance = new A();
console.log(
  instance.methodOnInstance() === instance.methodOnPrototype(), // true
  instance.methodOnPrototype.call('new this') === 'new this' // true
);
```


A common occurrence where the `this` changes is within an event handler, where the event handler calls the function passed into it and binds the context to the element on which the event happened (so overrides the value of `this` to be the element that was clicked or whatever the event was)

This happens in React as well for all ([synthetic](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)) DOM event handlers.

Therefore, if we want our method's context to always point to the instance of the React component, we can use the instance method.

Another way of restricting the context but not using the special instance method syntax that requires Babel is to directly create an instance method ourselves by creating a new function from the class (prototype) method with a bound context (using [Function.prototype.bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)):



```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    this.methodOnInstance = this.methodOnPrototype.bind(this);
  }
  methodOnPrototype() { return this; }
}

const instance = new A();
console.log(
  instance.methodOnInstance() === instance.methodOnPrototype(), // true
  instance.methodOnPrototype() === instance // true
);
```
This allows us to arrive to the same result as using the special instance method syntax but with the currently available tools (ES2017 and under).

If for some reason we want a method that is always bound to something that is not an instance of the class, we can do that as well:



```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    this.method = this.method.bind(console);
  }
  method() { return this; }
}

const instance = new A();
console.log(
  instance.method() === console // true
);
```
