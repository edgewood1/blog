Regular vs Arrow functions

**syntax**

```
var a = 4;
function z() {
  console.log(this.a) // 4
}
const y = () => {
  console.log(this.a) // 4
}// without curly bracket + single line, it auto returns
```



 **this keyword**: see `this` article

Arrow

- can't use with a constructor because `this` doesn't bind to contents of object - they are "unbound" (bound to window)

- `this` is *lexically bound*, ie  it uses`this` from the code that contains the arrow function. - which I believe means it always resolves to window?

- Arrow `this` will refer to the window, unless called by a bound call.

- As a way to describe the behavior of this in arrow functions, the term "lexical this" is somewhere between confusing and wrong. Instead: the arrow function does not define (or "bind") its own this.

- however if we use fat arrow for second function, it will be bound to the same function?

  however, we can also bind the anonymous function to "this" (whatever object 'this' is refering to)

Regular functions

- `this` contextually bound
- `this` value depends on where function/method called from (its EC)

**arguments binding**

- Arrow functions don't have an arguments binding, but they have access to the arguments object of closets non-arrow parent function.
- in arrows, we rely on named and rest parameters instead


**constructors**

**setTimeout (5)**
