Binding

'binding' is rough synonym for 'assignment'

`var x = 5` assigns  5 to x ... it also binds 5 to x 

bindings also refer to the current execution context of an object

**Execution context**

- an abstract concept that holds info about env within which current code is being executed 

**Process**

- JS enging begins
- global execution context (EC) created 
- `this` refers to EC - {this: window}
- engine executes a new function (gets piled on call stack)
- a new EC is created (the obj to which current execution belongs) + figures out:
  - its own scope (whihc variables / functions it has access to)
  - Its scope chain - references to outer scopes
  - value of this - an object on which code is executed



**execution context vs scope**

Scope

- Which variables and functions you have access to
- Depends on where you are (a *physical position*) within your code.



**Examples**

scope: greet is outside global scope

```
function sayHi () {
  var greet = 'Hello!'  // outside global
  console.log('1: ', greet)
}

sayHi()
console.log('2: ', greet)
```



**Details**

Unlike every other form of function, arrow functions do not have their own execution context.

Practically, this means that both this and arguments are inherited from their parent function.

all functions in js are closure

**execution context**

whenever a function / script is executed, a new CONTEXT is created. 

- global executation context (starting place)
- when you call a new function, a new execution context created and placed on top of the execution stack


Every call to execution context has 2 stages

- creation stage - context created but not invoked

  - here, variable enviornment componentis used for inital storage of variables, argujments, and functions declared
    - var variables are initalized with the value of undefined
  - the value of this is determined
  - at this stage, lexicalEnv is just the copy of VariableEnv

- execution stage - invokation

  - values are assigned
    Lexical Env is used to resolve bindings

  LexENv consists of: 

  - enviornemnt record (its inner env)
  - reference to outer / parent lexical enviornemnt

identifier resolution - occurs when the envorniment record reaches to the outer environment

- when inner reaches out to outer to resolve identifiers.
