Decorator - addy osmany
 
 
 Well, in Python, decorators provide a very simple syntax for calling higher-order functions. 
 A Python decorator is a function that takes another function, 
 extending the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. 

 @mydecorator
 def myfunc(): 
  pass

  @ - tells parser that we're using a decorator
  mydecorator - references a function by that name

  deocrator will take another function as an argument and retursn the same function with more functionality
