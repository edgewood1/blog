Closure

part one



closure - function  + ref to its outer scope (lexical env)
lexical env - map between local variable names + values
execution context - 

- every func maintains a references to its outer lex env.
- when the function is called, this env shapes the execution context.
- this ref allows code inside function to see variables outside

```
function foo() {
  const secret = 'hi'
  return function inner() {
    console.log(`The secret number is ${secret}.`)
  }
}
const f = foo() // `secret` is not directly accessible from outside `foo`
f() // but it is if we invoke f.  
Thus, f contains both the returned function + its a ref to its outer scope
```

part two 

A function enclosed within antoher

- inner function can access outer one's scope ( its surrounding state / lexical environment)
- inner function variables are private



Below, `makeFunc` will return a function that has a private variable, so 

```
function makeFunc() {
  var name = 'Mozilla'; // this becomes impossible to change from outside
  function displayName() {
    alert(name);
  }
  return displayName;
}

var myFunc = makeFunc();
myFunc();
```

1. `displayName()` returned before being executed.
2. its returned along with its surrounding state - in this case, `name` 
3. This surrounding state consists of any local variables that were in scope. 
4. nner functions have access to the variables of outer functions

Example 2

```
function makeAdder(x) {  // on creation, this function will create the state of x
  return function(y) {   // if used, it will accept y
    return x + y;        // it will then add y to x
  };
}

var add5 = makeAdder(5); // here we create a function with a state of x = 5
var add10 = makeAdder(10);

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add10(2)); // 12
```

1. makeAdder is a function factory
2. it creates functions that can add a specific value to their argument
3. above we create two functoins: one that adds 5 to the argument, and one that adds 10
4. makeAdder returns a function that holds a state (passed in during the first call)
5. this state is used anytime the created function is used.
