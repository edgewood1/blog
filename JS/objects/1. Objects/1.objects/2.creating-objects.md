__4 ways to Create an object__

1. initialize: 

```
  `const a = {name:'mel'}`
```

2. write a constructor function: 

```
  function Car(make) {this.make = make;}
  const b = new Car('honda')
```

3. The **`Object.create()`** static method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
    

```js
  const a = {key: 'a'}  // create source object
  const b = Object.create(a); // b is an empty object whose prototype is a
```

4. use the Object() constructor: 

```
`var x = new Object()`
```
