__Two categtories of datatypes__

1. reference ~ two items share same memory location
   - in order to 'de-reference' objects and clear up space, set object to null 
   
2. primitive
   -  a + b point to dedicated memory locations
   -  creates a natural <u>deep copy</u>
   -  eg:   - boolean, number, string, null, undefined

**Objects are susceptible to two kinds of copying:__** 

- shallow - new variable BOUND to the old

- deep copy - new variable INDEPENDENT of the old

**Breakdown**

| technique     | deep copy: non-nested | deep copy: nested |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| literal       | Yes                   |                   |
| Spreads       | Yes with caveat       |                   |
| Assignment    | No                    |                   |
| Object.assign | Yes with caveat       |                   |
| Object.create |                       |                   |
| Constructor   |                       |                   |

**Arrays:** 

- deep copies only if array is one-dimensional (no nested arrays)

nested array checker:
```js
function checkdeep(x, y) {
  if(x[1][0] == y[1][0]) return 'shallow';
  return 'deep';
}
```

1. assignment w/ nested -> shallow copy

```js
let a = [1, [1]]
let b = [...a]
b[1][0] = 2; // 
console.log(checkdeep(a, b)) // shallow
```

2. map / slice w/ nested --> deep

```js
a = [1, [1]]
// b = [...a, [...a[1]]]
b = a.map((arr) => Array.isArray(arr) ? arr.slice(): arr);

b[1][0] = 2;
console.log(checkdeep(a, b))
```



**React**

 React values shallow-equality checking - 

thus DOM rerenders only when an underlying object's reference has changed; (doesn't this happen only with deep copies)

thus, we avoid mutating objects and arrays

**Directly mutating the props object is not allowed** since this won't trigger any changes, and React doesn't notice the changes.
