**bind: ES6 Fat arrow**

create an object with a method (a nested function)

```
const obj1 = {
	a: 43,
	getA: () => this.a
}
foo.getX.call(obj1) // doesn't work ~ this is still window
```

since getA is an arrow function, `this` is only bound to the window object 

You cannot *rebind* `this` in an arrow function. It will always be defined as the context in which it was defined. If you require `this` to be meaningful you should use a normal function.

```
const x = obj1.getA() // undefined ~ see boottom link for work around
const 
```

**bind: ES5 -** 

```
var x = 10; 
let foo = {
	x: 90, 
	getX: function() { return this.x; } 
};

foo.getX(); // this = foo; prints 90
foo.getX.call(this) // this = this (window); prints 10
let xGetter = foo.getX; 

xGetter() // this = window; prints 10 
```



**bind: this = element**

```html
<div @click="hello"> click </div>
```

Here, `click` is called from HTMLElement

```js
hello(e) {
  console.log(e)
  this.jack()  // what is this? 
}
```

in constructor, redefine jack: 

```
this.jack = this.jack.bind()
```
