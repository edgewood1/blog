**What is a class?**

A class is a “special function”.  Just as there are function expressions and function declarations, there are:  

Class declarations, unlike function declarations, are not hoisted, so they must be declared before they are used. 

As a "special function" - 
- Any function can be invoked as a constructor with the keyword new and the prototype property of that function is used for the object to inherit methods from.


```js
class test {}
```

Class expressions? 

const Dog = class {} - class expression

- these can be named or not. 

**parts of a class:**

1. constructor ~ list all properties (in this case, the values are nodes) - required. Responsible for allocating memory for the objects of the class.  used to initialize an object created with a class.  use the super keyword to cal the construcot of the super class.  insnce properties are defined inside here. 

```js
class test {
  constructor() {
    this.grab = document.querySelector('#a')
    this.grab.addEventListener('click', this.go)
  }
```

Alternative:

```js
class A {
  method = () => {}
}
```
is same as 
```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    this.method = () => {}
  }
}
```



2. methods: ~ list all methods

```js
class test {
  constructor() {
		...
  }
  show() {
    console.log(this.grab)
    this.grab.innerHTML = "hello";
  }
```

Methods in 2 ways:
- print: function() {...}
- print() {...}



1. getters / setters  - this is more of a property / get and set will refer to the same 'method' name/  These are "named accesor propers.  
        why do we need a getter and setter? 
- allows us to add extra logic + checks

- syntax simpler than a method 
- secures better data quality - how?Getters and setters really only make sense when you have private properties of classes. We can create a private counter property that is handled in a getter / setter and not directly accessed from outside the object. 
- behaves like a variable object property
- offers the flexibility of a function to calculate its returned value on the fly. 
- It's basically a fancy way to create a function that doesn't require () when calling.
```js
class hello {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name.toUpperCase();
  }

  set name(newName) {
    console.log(arguments[0])
    this._name = newName; // validation could be checked here such as only allowing non numerical values
  }

}


const a = new hello;

a.name = "mel dejesus"

console.log(a.name)

```

4. static methods - identifies methods that can be called even iff class is not instantiated; however they CANT be called through a class instance - in such cases, they are used internally ~ used to create utility functions. You can define static data properties and prototype data properties outside the class body: 

 Rectangle.staticWidth = 20;
Rectangle.prototype.prototypeWidth = 25;

**Static Methods**

- accessible directly on the class
- not available on instantiations
- this = a (the class, not the instantiation)

```js
class a {
	static b() {
		console.log('2')
	}
	c() { // to access this, instantiate this class
	console.log('3')
	}
}
a.b() //2  - accessible without instantiation because static
a.c() // c is not a function
```
**Static properties**

```js
class Article {
  static publisher = "Ilya Kantor";
}

alert( Article.publisher ); // Ilya Kantor
```

 - what is autoboxing? or boxing? 

5. public/private field declarations - 

You can declare fields up-front
in a public way: height = 0;
or privately: #height = 0; * these can only be read / written within the class body. 

**Class fields**

These are set on the instantiated object, not User.prototype

```js
class User {
  name = "John";

  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }
}

new User().sayHi(); // Hello, John!
```


**public / private**

```js
class a {
	count = 0 // fields are public
}
const x = new a();
x.count = 5 // accessible from the outside
```

we can make private
prefix with an underscore by convention

```js
class a {
  _count = 0;
  get count() {
    return this._count;
  }
  set count(x) {
    if (x > 55) { // validate
      this._count = x;
    }
  }
}
const x = new a();
x._count =4; // now access is under control
```

Read-only? We just add a getter

Private field declarations  ----STOP
https://javascript.info/private-protected-properties-methods

```js
class CoffeeMachine {
  #waterLimit = 200;

  #fixWaterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) return 0;
    if (value > this.#waterLimit) return this.#waterLimit;
  }

  setWaterAmount(value) {
    this.#waterLimit = this.#fixWaterAmount(value);
  }

}

let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine();

// can't access privates from outside of the class
coffeeMachine.#fixWaterAmount(123); // Error
coffeeMachine.#waterLimit = 1000; // Error
```

**Class: an alternative to making objects**

- its essentially a constructor function by a different form 

Difference

- classes lack private scope for holding variables - explain

We add to constructor using prototype properity.  this conveys the property to all children.

Constructor, factory, and function

**CONSTRUCTOR**

```js
function ConstructorCar () {
  this.drive = function() {
    console.log("vroom")
  }
}

const car2 = new ConstructorCar();
car2.drive();
```

**Class**

```js
class ConstructorCar {
  drive() {
    console.log("vroom")
  }
}

const car2 = new ConstructorCar();
car2.drive();
```
