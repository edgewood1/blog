Base Class

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(living) {
    this.living = living;
    this.speed = 0;
  }
  run(x) {
    this.speed = x;
    console.log('he runs at ', this.speed)
  }
}
```

Extended class 
`extends` identifies which class we are borrowing from

```js
class Rabbit extends Animal {
  hide() {
    alert(`${this.name} hides!`);
  }
}

let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit"); // this uses the Animal constructor
rabbit.run(5); // White Rabbit runs with speed 5.
```
Extends could be followed by a function call that returns a class: 

```js
function f(phrase) {
  return class {
    sayHi() { alert(phrase); }
  };
}

class User extends f("Hello") {}

new User().sayHi(); // Hello
```

Super

super.method(...) to call a parent method.
super(...) to call a parent constructor (inside our constructor only).

Overriding

Here we override the function.

```js
class Dog extends Animal {
  hide() {
    // extra stuff
  }
  run(x) { // this overrides + extends the parent's run method
    super.run(x); // calls the original run
    this.hide() // does extra stuff
  }
}
```
If we don't use a constructor, it calls the parent constructor passing it all the arguments.
We can override the constructor
```js

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(living, sound) { // include parent + child props
    super(living) // this executes its parent constructor, which enables 'this'. it passes in the parent prop
    this.sound = sound; // child prop
  }
}

```
Last example ---> 

```js
class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    this.likesBaths = false;
  }
  meow() {
    console.log('Meow!');
  }
}
```

class field properties

If that's all you need, add the property using the class field property instead, avoiding the constructor, and the super.   

```js
class Cat extends Animal {
  likesBaths = false;
  meow() {
    console.log('Meow!');
  }
}
```

 

===========
 
 
Super

If a child class has a method of the same name as the parent class, the child method overrides the parent method. 

If we don’t totally want to replace a parent method, but build on top of it, we use the “super” keyword.

So if the parent class has this method: 

  stop() {
    this.speed = 0;
    alert(`${this.name} stopped.`);
  }
Our child class could have this method, using super to maintain the parent method and add on functionality: 

  stop() {
    super.stop(); // call parent stop
    this.hide(); // and then hide
  }

While this is a way of handling methods, what about constructors? 

Usually, child class don’t have their own constructors, so has this under the covers: 

class Rabbit extends Animal {
  // generated for extending classes without own constructors
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);
  }
}

If we try to add our own constructor, failure: 

class Rabbit extends Animal {

  constructor(name, earLength) {
    this.speed = 0;
    this.name = name;
    this.earLength = earLength;
  }


// Doesn't work!
let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit", 10); // Error: this is not defined.


To build a child constructor, you need to use super(…) before using this.

class Animal {

  constructor(name) {
    this.speed = 0;
    this.name = name;
  }

  // ...
}

class Rabbit extends Animal {

  constructor(name, earLength) {
    super(name);
    this.earLength = earLength;
  }

  // ...
}

Super – this is used in the child class and calls the constructor of  the parent class.  Used to access / call functions in object’s parent.  Must be used before the ‘this’.  
Super(5) // calls parents construcor; in this case passes the int 5 to the constructor.
Super.parentFunction() // calls parent’s function

Extends – used in class declarations to create a class as a child of another class.   If there is a constructor in the subclass, it needs to call super() before using ‘this’.


__SUBCLASSES__

```js
JS
var b = class a extends HTMLElement {
	constructor() {
      super();
    }
  	static hello() {
    return this;
    }
}
```

console.log(b)

**extends keyword** - allows class to become a child of another.

```js
class a {
  hi() {
    console.log('hi')
  }
}
class b extends a {
  bye() {
    console.log('bye')
  }
}
var c = new b();
c.hi()
```

Doing the same with function-based classes, but these functions must be construcible.  

```js
function a() {
}

a.prototype.hi = function() {
  console.log('hi')
}

class b extends a {
}
var c = new b();
c.hi();
```
