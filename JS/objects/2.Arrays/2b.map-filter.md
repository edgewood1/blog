**Combining filter / map**

<hr></hr>



**Data-set**

```
const ar1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, '']
const ar2 = [3, 5]
```



**Chaining filter / map**

ar1.filter((el) => el).map(e => e+2)

ar2.map((el) => el+2).filter(e=> e>3)



**map / find**

notice that parenthesis is used instead of curly braces

this allows for line-breaks when working in typescript

```
(this.itemArray as Item[]) = this.itemArray.filter((item) => (
      this.selectedSites.find((site) => (item.Site === (site as SiteObj).Code))
    ));
```

**Nesting filter / map**

```js
ar1.map( a => {
  // [1, 2, 3, 4, ''] will be gone through
  // for each of these items there will be 2 iterations:
  let c = ar2.filter(b => {
    console.log(b, a)
    // filter out anything that is not b
    return b === 3 
    // you could also use find 
  }) 
  console.log('result' , c); 
  return a + [c]; // since filter returns an array, you'll have to destructure c
  // .find() would only return a number, not an array... 
})
```





```js
let arr3 = []
let arr4 = []
console.log('hi')
ar1.forEach(a => {
  arr3 = ar2.map(b => b+a)  // alone, this would over-write arr3 on each outer iteration
  arr4 = [...arr4, ...arr3] // so "push" it to an accumulator
})
arr4

// you could also just use reduce?
```
