var 

- globally/function-scoped
- can be updated / red-declared in their scope
- are initialized with undefined
- doesn't have to be initialized during declaration

let 

- block-scoped 
- not initialized with undefined
- mutable - can be updated / red-declared in scope
- doesn't have to be initialized during declaration

```
let r = {a: 4}
r.a = 3 // allowed
a = {b: 2} // allowed
```

const 

- *block-scoped* 
- *not initialized with undefined ( same as let)*
- immutable: can't be updated / re-declared

- must be initailzed during declaration
- That is, let / const not accessible before its declaration (temporal dead zone)

```
const r = {a: 3}
r.a = 5 // allowed
r = {b: 4} //not
const z = [1, 2, 3]
z.push(5) // not allowed
```



const hello = 'a''

hello = 'b' // not allowed.



Declare, initialize, and assign

declare - registers a variable in the corresponding scope

declaration types: var, let, const

initlizae / define - allocates memory for the variable (assign a value?)

assignment - assigns a specified value to the variable

reassign

- adds a new value

Two kinds of reassignment

**All declarations** (`var`, `let`, `const`, `function`, `function*`, `class`) **are "hoisted"** in JavaScript. This means that if a name is declared in a scope, in that scope the identifier will always reference that particular variable:

https://www.sitepoint.com/demystifying-javascript-variable-scope-hoisting/

a variable assignment wtihout declaration creates a global.  It's implicitly declared

**What is immutability**

- a datastructure that doesn't change in value



What's an example? Strings and numbers



```
var myString = "I am immutable"
myString[2] = 'c'
console.log(myString)
```

If you want to change that string, you'll either have to assign to a new variable: 

```
var newString = myString.slice(0,7);
```

or reassign:

```
myString = "I am imcutable"
```

or redeclare....

**What's an example of mutability?**

objects and arrays

```
var a = [1, 2, 3]; a.push(5);
var b = {name: mel}; b[name] = charles; 
```

A lot of the array methods that you use every day are Mutator methods. Hereâ€™s the list of Array methods that operate on the original array.

- copyWithin
- fill
- pop
- push
- reverse
- shift
- sort
- splice
- unshift

Methods like map and filter are immutable because they create a new array without mutating the original array. You can verify this by running an example like this:
