Three areas.

1. working tree (untracked)
2. staging / index tree (tracked files ~ but my update them in git regularly)
3. local repository - everythign in your .git directory. / all your commits

commit - a checkpoint telling git to tack changes to this point using last commit as a comparison. 

shows the local repo: git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD

- captures a snapshot of currently staged changes.

- initialize with git in a directory that contains no code (empty repo)
- this comes with a "main" branch that has nothing on it
- create a new branch - this will have nothing to



- initialize git, but CLONE a remote branch
- this "main" will have the cloned code
- create a new branch - this will have the cloned code
- now you can make changes in this branch and it doesn't affect previous



What is a branch? 

- a pointer to one of these commits



==============
