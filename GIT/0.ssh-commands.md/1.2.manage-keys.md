**ssh process** 

- .ssh directory: contains private keys
- Ssh-agent: authenticates so you don't need passwords
- ssh-add command - adds private keys to ssh agent.  

**1. What keys are in your ssh directory?**

`ls -al ~/.ssh`

**2. What SSH keys are attached to the ssh-agent**

`ssh-add -l`  // this agent has no identies (or if it does, it will show identities)

​		**Variations**

​			L ~ full key

​			-l ~ fingerprint 

**3. Add the keys to the ssh-agent /switch users**

`ssh-add <path-to-keys>`

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_edgewood1




__Remove all ssh entries from the ssh-agent__

`ssh-add -D`
