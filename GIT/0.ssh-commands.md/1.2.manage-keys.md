**ssh process**

- .ssh directory: contains private keys
- Ssh-agent: authenticates so you don't need passwords
- ssh-add command - adds private keys to ssh agent.

**1. What keys are in your ssh directory?**

`ls -al ~/.ssh`

**2. What SSH keys are attached to the ssh-agent**

`ssh-add -l`  // this agent has no identies (or if it does, it will show identities)

 		**Variations**

 			L ~ full key

 			-l ~ fingerprint

**3. Add the keys to the ssh-agent /switch users**

`ssh-add <path-to-keys>`

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_edgewood1




__Remove all ssh entries from the ssh-agent__

`ssh-add -D`


When you're cloning a repository to a new computer, you would typically use the original SSH URL (git@github.com:edgewood1/blog.git). After cloning, you can then change the remote URL to use the git-local host if you have it set up in your SSH config file on the new computer.

Here's how you can do it:

Clone the repository:
git clone git@github.com:edgewood1/blog.git
Change the remote URL to use the git-local host:
cd blog
git remote set-url origin git-local:edgewood1/blog.git
This assumes that you have a host named git-local defined in your ~/.ssh/config file on the new computer, and that the SSH key associated with that host is added to your GitHub account. If not, you'll need to set that up before you can use git-local.
