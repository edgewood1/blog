With that, whenever you run ssh it will look for keys in Keychain Access. If it finds one, you will no longer be prompted for a password. Keys will also automatically be added to ssh-agent every time you restart your machine.

    AddKeysToAgent
             Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running ssh-agent(1).  If
             this option is set to yes and a key is loaded from a file, the key and its
             passphrase are added to the agent with the default lifetime, as if by ssh-add(1).
             If this option is set to ask, ssh(1) will require confirmation using the SSH_ASKPASS
             program before adding a key (see ssh-add(1) for details).  If this option is set to
             confirm, each use of the key must be confirmed, as if the -c option was specified to
             ssh-add(1).  If this option is set to no, no keys are added to the agent.  The
             argument must be yes, confirm, ask, or no (the default).
