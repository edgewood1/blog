But they could probably search the file structure.  
~/.ssh ls -la // show all permissions

scp ~/.ssh/key_id.pub un@-:/home/../.ssh?

**changing permissions**

chmod 700 ~/.ssh?

ssh key - bypass pw

generate keys

ssh permissions too open



should be: 0600



Check permissions: 



ls -l

<file-permission><owner><group><created-date>

File-permission

<file-type><user><group><others>

| File-type | meaning      |
| --------- | ------------ |
| **-**     | regular file |
| d         | directory    |
| i         | Link         |

| File permissions | meaning |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| r                | read    |
| w                | write   |
| x                | Execute |
|                  |         |
|                  |         |

change file permissions

Chmod [permission] [filename]

chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx [file_name]

Instead of letters, the octal format represents privileges with numbers:

- **r**(ead) has the value of **4**
- **w**(rite) has the value of **2**
- (e)**x**(ecute) has the value of **1**
- **no permission** has the value of **0**

The privileges are summed up and depicted by one number. Therefore, the possibilities are:

- **7 –** for read, write, and execute permission
- **6 –** for read and write privileges
- **5** – for read and execute privileges
- **4** – for read privileges

chmod 644 test.txt
