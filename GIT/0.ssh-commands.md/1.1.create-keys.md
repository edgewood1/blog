__creating keys__

go to:

```
~/.ssh
```

generate a key to your files: 

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

enter file: osmosis

enter passphrase: github11

**Ways to copy key to server**

**1: install key as an "authorized key" on server**

```
ssh-copy-id 
```

This logs into the server host, and copies keys to the server, and configures them to grant access by adding them to the [authorized_keys](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys) file. The copying may ask for a password or other authentication for the server.

Only the public key is copied to the server. The private key should never be copied to another machine.



**2**

**look inside the created file to ensure a key is present**

```
cat osmosis.pub 
```

or __copy that command  (last path = filename saved as)__

```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

__go to github: account / settings / ssh and gpg keys__

- click: new ssh keys

- paste contain and assign key.  add key

__register keys with the ssh-agent__

Ensure ssh-agent is running using: `eval $(ssh-agent -s)`

Returns somethign like: `Agent pid 5483`

The **authorized_keys** file should contain the *public* key, not the *private* one. 

The following command should have used the **id_dsa.pub** file instead:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

The **known_hosts** file is for host keys, so that is as expected.
