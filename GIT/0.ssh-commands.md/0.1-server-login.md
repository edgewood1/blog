**Log into a server**

The `ssh` command provides a secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network. This connection can also be used for terminal access, file transfers, and for tunneling other applications.

ssh username@serverhost/ipaddress/domain

ssh brad@192.55.333.33

Here, you tell computer, securely log into 192.55... using the username "brad".  If you get in, you are able to run commands on their terminal.  However, this user would only have certain privilieges - so maybe they can't wipe the hard drives
