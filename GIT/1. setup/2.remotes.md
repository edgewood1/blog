remote commands

The git remote command is meant for manipulating (working with, adding, and removing) remotes. It has ten (!) sub-commands:

git remote remove
git remote set-branches
git remote set-head
git remote get-url
git remote set-url
git remote show
git remote prune
git remote update

**REMOTE ARGUMENTS**

remote show origin | show full output of origin - shows head, remote branches, and how they are linked 

 

 

remote set-url origin <url> | change the url of an exist remote

remote prune <repo> | delete tracking branches whose remote branches removed

**REMOTE FLAGS** 

remote -v   | shows the name and url of remote repo 



push â€“set-upstream origin remote_branch | tells GIT to always push a local branch (checked-out) to a remote branch.  You must check out this local branch first. After this, you only have to 'git push' not 'git push origin master'.



git remote update will update all of your branches set to track remote ones, but not merge any changes in.





__add existing project to github__
git add / commit 
git remote add origin remote repository URL





s__show remote__

git remote -v

git show origin remote

__add remote__

What git remote add is for is to add a new remote. If you have one remote now, and you add another, you will then have two remotes. If you have none, and add one, you will have one.

`git remote add <name> <url>`

name - name of repo
url - ssh://user@host/path/to/repo.git

git remote add origin git@github.com:mel-dejesus/todo.git

__add remote part 2__

What git remote set-url is for is, mainly, to change the URL associated with some existing remote. Hence it takes the name of an existing remote, and a new URL. The default action is to remove the old URL and insert the new one instead.

`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git`

__commit / push__

$ git commit -am "Update README.md"
$ git push
