- create a github account
- create a repo
- clone repo using HTTPS (difference?)

Confirm

right branch / stage?

```
git status
```

 Right repo?

```
git remote -v
```

Two options

- default branch main - make changes push
- feature branch next - make changes push

If you want to create a new "git file"

```
git init
```
