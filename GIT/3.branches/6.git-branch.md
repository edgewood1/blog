**BRANCH**

branch <branch> |  create a local branch -- c

Reminder: 

- HEAD is where the next commit would appear..
- Branch is a label that refers to a commit
- Branches have to be checked out in order to extend them.
- We extend them through commits
- We can create multiple labels / branches on a single commit.

checkout - switches which branch is the active one. // which is HEAD

git branch testing

- this creates a new LABEL on current commit.  AKA a new branch
- If HEAD is on branch A, `git branch B`, then HEAD is still on branch A
- If we commit while HEAD is on branch A, we extend A. 

This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:

```
$ git branch -v -a
```
