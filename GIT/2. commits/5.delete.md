`deleting files`

if untracked, and we delete, no big deal
if tracked files/commit

1. delete file from finder, then commit deletion:
2. use `git rm <filename>`
3. commit: `git commit -m "msg"` 

OR 

just #2 and #3 above
-- but this does a unix remove (completely gone, not even in the trash) -- 

 // delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName

`DELETE FROM REMOTE: STEPS`

1. remove it from your wd, then commit / push.

2. remove it from staging area (your cache)

3. commit / push

   git rm -r foldername
   git rm --cached file1.txt
   git commit -m "remove file1.txt"q
   git push origin branch_name

delete remote

# Executive Summary

```sh
$ git push -d <remote_name> <branchname>
$ git branch -d <branchname>
```

**Note:** In most cases, `<remote_name>` will be `origin`.

# Delete Local Branch

To delete the ***local*** branch use one of the following:

```
$ git branch -d <branch_name>
$ git branch -D <branch_name>
```
