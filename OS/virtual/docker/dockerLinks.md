You can run a script, or a more complex parameter to the RUN. Here is an example from a Dockerfile I've downloaded to look at previously:

RUN cd /opt && unzip treeio.zip && mv treeio-master treeio && \
 rm -f treeio.zip && cd treeio && pip install -r requirements.pip

Because of the use of '&&', it will only get to the final 'pip install' command if all the previous commands have succeeded.
