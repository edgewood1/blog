image - a file with all  deps / configs needed to run a program

container - image instance / program

docker for mac
1. docker client (CLI) - we will enter commands into terminal and this will manage them.  doesnt do anything with images, etc.  just a means of interacting

2. docker server (daemon) - creates images, etc.  it recieves commands from the client.  

install docker for mac

docker version

using docker client

=======


run commands on docker client
processes them and sends to docker server

`docker run hello-world``

start a new container using image of 'hellow-world'
this image has a program inside to print otu xyz

run command.
docker server sees we're startign to start a container
check if there's a local copy in the image cache.  no?
so go to docker hub repo (free images for doownload).
does this image live there? yes!~
download hellow-world file
stores it in image cache
container is image instance whose purpose is to run 1 program
docker creates a container and runs single program inside of it

what is a container? 

__how does os run?__

chrome, terminals, spotify, node
make system calls to kernel
kernel makes calls to cpu, memory, hard disk

nodejs > kernel > hard disk

kernel intermediary between software / hardware
system calls are like function calls
kernel exposes endpoints that can be called


what if 
chrome requires python v2
nodejs requires python v3
yet hard disk only has v3
and we can't have both at same time.
thus only nodejs would work.

namespacing 
- segmenting the hard drive
- assigning oen segment to house one app (python v2 vs v3)
- make sure one app is assigned to one segment
- kernel makes this decision: if app1 calls harddrive, call directed to segment 
- thus node / chrome can work on same machine. 
- isolate resources per process


control group 
- limit amount of resources used per proces
- resources: memory, cpu usage, hd i/o, network bandwidth

container
- an isolated app, the kernel, segment of [HD, network, RAM, CPU]

What is image vs container? 

image
- single file w/ list of deps and config required to run program
- consists of FS snapshot (chrome/python)
- + startu command
- fs snapshot placed into a segment of HD
- start up command, invokes file in HD, which runs a process

namespacing / controlgroups is a LINUX thing
yet running on macos / windows.

When we install docker for mac, we installed a linux VM
inside VM all containers created
VM has a linux kernel that hosts containers 
each container is runnign a process

==== 
section 2 - 15

we use an image to create a container

docker - reference to docker client
run - create run container

docker run <image-name>

- creates container
- adds image to HD
- runs image as an instance-process
