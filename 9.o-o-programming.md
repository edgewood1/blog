Principles of object-oriented programming (VS functional programming?)

1 - Inheritence – creating new child classes based on the features of a parent class.  

    Inheritance; reuse of base classes to form derived classes. Some object to this, as other mechanisms exist (interface inheritance, delegation, structural typing) to implement subtypes.
    Javascript does provide a fairly easy means to inherit implementation via prototyping but this is at the expense of encapsulation.


2 - Abstraction – define and execute abstract actions …  creating a simple model of a more complex thing, which represents its most important aspects in a way that is easy to work with for our program's purposes.

3 - Encapsulation – hide the internals of a class --- Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly (the official word is encapsulated) inside an object package (which can be given a specific name to refer to, which is sometimes called a namespace), making it easy to structure and access; objects are also commonly used as data stores that can be easily sent across the network.  Encapsulation; there are means to segregate an object's interface from its implementation.

    Javascript does this; Python also has no mechanism to enforce encapsulation. All members of a Python object are effectively public, and Python only uses naming conventions to indicate that a member should be treated as "private". But no one questions whether or not Python is an OO language

4 - Polymorphism – access a class through its parent interface. – the ability to use a class in order to instantiate multiple object types that have the same functionality.  Polymorphism – there are many types and all languages do it. 

In most ObjectOriented Languages: Polymorphism = Encapsulation + Inheritance
