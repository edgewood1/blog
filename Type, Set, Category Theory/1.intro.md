Sets are a 0-dimensional entity; a datatype with an equality relation



```
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

- set thoery is built on top eof logic.
- we talk about elements and sets

Category is a 1-dimensional entitty

- we talk about sets and morphisms arrows
- arrows define the various relations between structorues.

OOP Classes consist of data and methods (which act on data).  This divide doesn't exist in categories.  

Type theory is most related to classes in OOP

- used most in functional programming
- we talk about types and terms: 
- 2 and 1 +1 are two different terms, but they are both of one type: natural numbers.
- 2:nat means 2 is of type nat.



Analogies  

- Logic -> Proof theory. There is an emphasis in manipulating proof as mathematical objects in your deductive system.
- Type theory -> algorithms. There is an emphasis in manipulating algorithms which are just a collection of instructions.
- Category Theory -> algebra. Here the emphasis is on manipulating algebraic objects using algebraic rules.
