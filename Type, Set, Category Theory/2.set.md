Discrete Math - deals with finite sets rather than infinite sets. 
Set - a collection of elements. It is determined by its elements, not the order.  Denoted by capital letters.

```
A = { 4 }
```

These are all the same set: 

```
{1, 2, 3, 4}
{1, 4, 3, 2}
{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4}
```

Symbols

```
E  "membership relation" ~ 

x E A means "x is an element of A"
```

Natural Numbers

N = { 0, 1, 2, 3 ...}

Integers

Z = { ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...}

Set-builder notation. x | P(x)

the set of all x such that property P(x) is true ... | = such that

{ 2, 2, 4, 6}

n | n is an even positive integer less than or equal to 6

n E Z | n is even, ) < n < 6

Empty set - athe unique set with no elements.  We use symbol of O with cross through it.  

Sets within sets

A = { a, { b, c, }}

b is not a member of A; rather {b, c} is a member of A

Cardinality of a fnite set A is written |A| is the number of elements of A

so |{ a, b}| = 2
