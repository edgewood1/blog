You must have a at least one "is tested by" issue link to Resolve an Defect, New Feature or Improvement

- open study
- workflow > start (Or just move it bak to Ready status which triggers a test to be added.  
)

When the issue doesn't have a test linked to it, then it will be blocked. Typically this occurs automatically when it switches status. If it's not there for some reason you can move it back to Ready status which should trigger a test being added.
The view workflow link shows which action will take it back to Ready
