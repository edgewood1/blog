Quick Way to Add an Issue to a Sprint
 
When issues are added, is there a quick way to add the issue to a sprint from the issue navigator?

Currently we do the following to add the issue to the sprint:

1. Browse to issue in issue navigator

2. Click "View of Board" link under Agile section

3. Select Board from pop-up

4. Right-click issue and send to the desired sprint

Fewer steps would be desirable.
