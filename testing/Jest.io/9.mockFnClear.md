Mock Functions have a mock property.

A mock property is an object that contains data about 

- calls ~ stores the arguments used on each call.
- instances ~ contains the `this` value used on each invocation. 
- results ~ array will store how and with which value the function exited each invocation.

mock.calls is an array that gets various info

You can clear these:

###### **<u>[`mockFn.mockClear()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api#mockfnmockclear)</u>**

- clears out the array
- keeps the mocked implementation

##### <u>**[`mockFn.mockReset()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api#mockfnmockreset)**</u>

- clears out the array
- removes any mocked return values / implementation, so undefined is returned

**<u>[`mockFn.mockRestore()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api#mockfnmockrestore)</u>**

- clears out the mock entirely so that the original implementation is restored.
