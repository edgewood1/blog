**React Testing library**

- helps rendering comps into v-dom
- helps with searching v-dom
- allows interacting w/ v-dom
- needs a test runner - Jest (others are mocha, etc)

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

**render**

```
render(<App />)
```

- creates creates a virtual DOM for the JSX argument (App in this case)

**screen**

  - object containing V-DOM
  - has methods for accessing V-DOM
    - getByText(string or regEx) = find element by display text


```
  const link = screen.getByText('learn react);
```

- screen is a object-representation of <App>
- we use a method to search for a particular text
- we store this node in link

**Expect**

- a jest method that allows you to test a value, usually by comparison 
- it comes with matchers that let you validate different things. 
- Argument can be a method, string, Dom-node

```
  expect(link).toBeInTheDocument();
```
