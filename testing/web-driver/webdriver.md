WebDriver bindings for Node.js

WebdriverIO lets you control a browser or a mobile application with just a few lines of code. 
- The integrated test runner let you write asynchronous commands in a synchronous way so that you donâ€™t need to care about how to handle a Promise to avoid racing conditions. 
- When fetching or looping over elements you can use just native JavaScript functions. With the $ and $$ functions WebdriverIO provides useful shortcuts which can also be chained in order to move deeper in the DOM tree without using complex xPath selectors.
- The test runner also comes with a variety of hooks that allow you to interrupt the test process in order to e.g. take screenshots if an error occurs or modify the test procedure according to a previous test result.
