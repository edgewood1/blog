cross-site-refere

craft a url that peforms an action
tricks user to click on that link

get the actual url
change it
hide it under image / link 

authnetication cookie included w/request -

instead use csrf session tokens

auth cookie vs csrf session token 

how does using a particular url 
imply an authnetication cookie

CSRF - 
i take/steal a valid url to someone's bank account
disguise it as a button
get someone to click on it
a request goes out
how does a valid auth cookie get added to request? 
would i have to steal the cookie?

create an invisible iframe (w/face book like)
place over my amazon page
so when i click my cart button
i actually click another facebook like button

IFRAME
whats worse click-jacking

1) iframe main method for click-jacking?
2) cs disabled if iframes allowed in insecure spaces
