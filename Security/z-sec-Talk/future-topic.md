An alternative might be to have a 1-week design sprint followed by a 3-week dev sprint.  But we'd have to customize how that's done to meet our own needs.

github keys vulnerability

github keys security

 Debian OpenSSL bug from 2008. That vulnerability existed in certain versions of Debian and resulted from the fact that the OpenSSL random number generator included in those versions was predictable. That means that cryptographic keys generated with vulnerable versions could be guessable. The bug affected SSH keys, VPN keys, and DNSSEC keys, among others

 how does this wrk? 
 random number generator in Debian's
openssl package is predictable.  This is caused by an incorrect
Debian-specific change to the openssl package (CVE-2008-0166).  As a
result, cryptographic key material may be guessable.
