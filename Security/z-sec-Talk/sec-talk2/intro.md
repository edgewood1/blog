Welcome
For my last presentation, 
I tried to figure out two items 
from the OWASP top 10.
It had to do with 
How weak User verification / session management 
Could lead to stolen passwords / tokens 
This time 
I considered revisiting that same topic, but in more detail 
But instead, I chose the topic of the Solarwinds hack, only because 
It’s getting big media play 
It’s what i know nothing about.
Not surprisingly,  
Stolen passwords / tokens do feature in the SW narrative
