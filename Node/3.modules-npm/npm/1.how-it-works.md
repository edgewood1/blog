npm 

npm i 

- downloads dependencies defined in a package.json file 
- generates a node_modules folder with the installed modules
- if arguments included, then only specfc modules downloaded
- run npm i command in same location as the package.json file
- generates package-lock.json ~ describes the exact depednecy tree that was installed.



What ia a dependecy tree? 

- different packages require different versions of the same module
- if A requires C1 and B requires C2, then C1 and C2 are installed in a tree
- the order the depenecies are installed dictates tree structure: c1 may get installed in root level while c2 is installed as a nested dependncy of B.  the lock file ensures these levels are maintained.

arguments

npm install express

Npm install express@4.4.4

npm install express eslint

npm install my folder ~ does this go to that folder, install all its package.json, but in root?

npm install -g // package installed in two places - root directory where package.json defined and then the global node_modules folder on the user system.  install globally when used across projects.
