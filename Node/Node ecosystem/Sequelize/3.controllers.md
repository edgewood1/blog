## Step 3 — Using Sequelize for Database Queries

Controllers: built-in queries for insertion, selection, selection with conditional clauses, and deletion.

Controllers handle query logic

### **Inserting a New Record**

After creating model in db, you'll insert data 

- To get started, copy the contents of `book.model.js` from the previous step. 
- Create a new file called `book.controller.js` to handle the query logic. 
- Add the code from `book.model.js` to `book.controller.js`.
- In `book.controller.js`, locate the `sync()` method. 
- In the `sync()` method, add the following highlighted lines:

/hello-world/book.controller.js

```javascript
...

sequelize.sync().then(() => {
   console.log('Book table created successfully!');

   Book.create({
       title: "Clean Code",
       author: "Robert Cecil Martin",
       release_date: "2021-12-14",
       subject: 3
   }).then(res => {
       console.log(res)
   }).catch((error) => {
       console.error('Failed to create a new record : ', error);
   });

}).catch((error) => {
   console.error('Unable to create table : ', error);
});
```

Copy

- Here, you insert a new book record into the `books` model you’ve already created using the `sync()` method, which supports adding new records to previously created models. 
- Once the sync() method executes successfully, it runs the `then()` method. 
- Inside the `then()` method, you call `create()` method to insert the new records to the model.

You use the `create()` method to pass the data you need to add to the database as an object. The highlighted section of code will insert a new entry to your existing `books` table. In this example, you add `Clean Code` by `Robert Cecil Martin`, which has been categorized with the `subject` ID of `3`. You can use the same code, updated with information for other books, to add new records to your database.

Save and close the file.

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
node book.controller.js
```

Copy

Your output will look similar to the following:

```
Outputbooks {
  dataValues:
   { id: 1,
     title: 'Clean Code',
     author: 'Robert Cecil Martin',
     release_date: '2021-12-14',
     subject: 3,
     updatedAt: 2021-12-14T10:12:16.644Z,
   ...
}
```

You inserted a new record to the model you created in the database. You can continue adding multiple records using the same process.

### **Selecting All Records**

In this section, you will select and get all the book records from the database using the `findAll()` method. To do that, first open `book.controller.js` and remove the previous `Book.create()` method. In the `sync()` method, add the `Book.findAll()` method as shown:

/hello-world/book.controller.js

```javascript
...

sequelize.sync().then(() => {

    Book.findAll().then(res => {
        console.log(res)
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.error('Failed to retrieve data : ', error);
    });

}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to create table : ', error);
});

...
```

Copy

Save and close the file.

Next, run the application again using the following command:

```bash
node book.controller.js
```

Copy

Your output will look similar to the following:

```
Output[
  books {
    dataValues: {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Clean Code',
      author: 'Robert Cecil Martin',
      release_date: '2020-01-01',
      subject: 3,
      createdAt: 2021-02-22T09:13:55.000Z,
      updatedAt: 2021-02-22T09:13:55.000Z
    },
    _previousDataValues: {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Clean Code',
      author: 'Robert Cecil Martin',
      release_date: '2020-01-01',
      subject: 3,
      createdAt: 2021-02-22T09:13:55.000Z,
      updatedAt: 2021-02-22T09:13:55.000Z
    },
...
]
```

The output contains all book data as an array object. You successfully used the Sequelize `findAll()` method to return all book data from the database.

### **Selecting with the `where` Clause**

In this section, you will select values with conditions using the [`where`](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-querying-basics/#applying-where-clauses) clause. The `where` clause is used to specify a condition while fetching data. For this tutorial, you will get a book by a specific record ID from the database using the `findOne()` method.

To do that, open `book.controller.js` for editing, delete the `findAll()` method, and add the following lines:

/hello-world/book.controller.js

```javascript
...

sequelize.sync().then(() => {

    Book.findOne({
        where: {
            id : "1"
        }
    }).then(res => {
        console.log(res)
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.error('Failed to retrieve data : ', error);
    });

}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to create table : ', error);
});
```

Copy

Here, you select a specific book record from the database using the `findOne()` method with the `where` option. In this example, you are retrieving the book data whose `id` is equal to `1`.

Save and close the file.

Next, run the application:

```bash
node book.controller.js
```

Copy

Your output will look similar to the following:

```
Outputbooks {
  dataValues: {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Clean Code',
    author: 'Robert Cecil Martin',
    release_date: '2020-01-01',
    subject: 'Science',
    createdAt: 2021-02-22T09:13:55.000Z,
    updatedAt: 2021-02-22T09:13:55.000Z
  },
  ...
}
```

You have successfully used `where` clauses to get data from Sequelize models. You can use the `where` clause in the database application to capture conditional data.

### **Deleting a Record**

To delete a specific record from the database model, you use the `destroy()` method with the `where` option. To do that, open `book.controller.js`, remove the `findOne()` method, and add the following highlighted lines:

/hello-world/book.controller.js

```javascript
...
sequelize.sync().then(() => {

  Book.destroy({
      where: {
        id: 2
      }
  }).then(() => {
      console.log("Successfully deleted record.")
  }).catch((error) => {
      console.error('Failed to delete record : ', error);
  });

}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to create table : ', error);
});
```

Copy

Here, you remove a book record from the database by using the `destroy()` method with the `where` option and passing in the `id` of the book to remove. You are going to remove the book record whose `id` equals `2`.

Save and close the file.

Next, run the application:

```bash
node book.controller.js
```

Copy

Your output will look like the following:

```
OutputSuccessfully deleted record.
```

The record has been deleted.

In this step, you experimented with your database model and model querying. You initiated the database, created models, inserted records, retrieved records, retrieved records with conditions using the `where` clause, and deleted selected records. With this knowledge of Sequelize, you will now create associations in Sequelize. After that, you will be able to define and work with a variety of relationships using Sequelize models.
