## Step 5 — Working with Raw Queries

In this step, you will work with [raw queries](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/raw-queries/) in Sequelize. In previous steps, you used Sequelize built-in methods, such as `insert()` and `findAll()`, to handle data insertion and selection from the database. You may have noticed that those methods follow a specific pattern for writing a query. However, with the use of raw queries, you don’t need to worry about Sequelize built-in methods and patterns. Using your knowledge of SQL queries, you can conduct a range of queries in Sequelize from simple to more advanced.

Here is an example of raw queries that perform the action of selecting all values from a particular table, deleting the selected values according to the condition, and updating the table with the given values.

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
UPDATE table_name SET y = 42 WHERE x = 12;
```

In Sequelize, raw queries can be used with primarily two methodologies: array replacement and object replacement. When you are passing values to the SQL query, you can use either an array or an object to do that replacement.

Before writing a raw query, you will first need to supply student data in a sample database. Following the previous section, [Creating a Sample Database](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sequelize-with-node-js-and-mysql#creating-a-sample-database), log in to MySQL, create a database called `sample_student_db`, and log out of MySQL.

Next, you’ll add some raw data to start working with raw queries. Create a new file called `add_student_records.js` and add the following code blocks, which contain the previously discussed Sequelize methods of `authenticate()`, `sync()`, and `bulkCreate()`.

/hello-world/add_student_records.js

```javascript
const {Sequelize, DataTypes} = require("sequelize");

const sequelize = new Sequelize(
   'sample_student_db',
   'DATABASE_USERNAME',
   'DATABASE_PASSWORD',
    {
      host: 'DATABASE_HOST',
      dialect: 'mysql'
    }
   );

sequelize.authenticate().then(() => {
    console.log('Connection has been established successfully.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to connect to the database: ', error);
});

const Student = sequelize.define("students", {
    student_id: {
        type: DataTypes.UUID,
        defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4,
        primaryKey: true,
    },
    name: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false
    }
});

const student_data = [
    {name : "John Baker"},
    {name : "Max Butler"},
    {name : "Ryan Fisher"},
    {name : "Robert Gray"},
    {name : "Sam Lewis"}
]

sequelize.sync({ force: true }).then(() => {

    Student.bulkCreate(student_data, { validate: true }).then((result) => {
        console.log(result);
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });

}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to create table : ', error);
});
```

Copy

Here, you initiate the database connection, create the model, and insert a few student records inside the new database.

Save and close the file.

Next, run this script using the following command:

```bash
node add_student_records.js
```

Copy

The output will be something similar to the following. It will be quite long, but all the student records which you inserted will be returned as follows. Note that since the `student_id` is an auto-generated UUID ([Universally Unique Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) value, it will be different depending on the user.

```
OutputExecuting (default): SELECT 1+1 AS result
Executing (default): DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `students`;
Connection has been established successfully.
Executing (default): DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `students`;
Executing (default): CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `students` (`student_id` CHAR(36) BINARY , `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, `createdAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, `updatedAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`student_id`)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
Executing (default): SHOW INDEX FROM `students`
Executing (default): INSERT INTO `students` (`student_id`,`name`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES ('45d1f26c-ba76-431f-ac5f-f41282351710','John Baker','2022-06-03 07:27:49','2022-06-03 07:27:49'),('1cb4e34d-bfcf-4a97-9624-e400b9a1a5f2','Max Butler','2022-06-03 07:27:49','2022-06-03 07:27:49'),('954c576b-ba1c-4dbc-a5c6-8eaf22bbbb04','Ryan Fisher','2022-06-03 07:27:49','2022-06-03 07:27:49'),('e0f15cd3-0025-4032-bfe8-774e38e14c5f','Robert Gray','2022-06-03 07:27:49','2022-06-03 07:27:49'),('826a0ec9-edd0-443f-bb12-068235806659','Sam Lewis','2022-06-03 07:27:49','2022-06-03 07:27:49');
[
  students {
    dataValues: {
      student_id: '45d1f26c-ba76-431f-ac5f-f41282351710'`,
      name: 'John Baker',
      createdAt: 2022-06-03T07:27:49.453Z,
      updatedAt: 2022-06-03T07:27:49.453Z
    },
    _previousDataValues: {
      name: 'John Baker',
      student_id: '45d1f26c-ba76-431f-ac5f-f41282351710',
      createdAt: 2022-06-03T07:27:49.453Z,
      updatedAt: 2022-06-03T07:27:49.453Z
    },

…
```

In the next section, you will apply raw queries using one of the `student_id` outputs in the code block above. Copy it down so that you have it for the next sections, where you will use the `query()` method for array and object replacements.

### Array Replacement

In this section, you’ll use the `query()` method for an array replacement. With this method, Sequelize can execute raw or already prepared SQL queries.

To get started, copy the contents of the `server.js` file from [Step 1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sequelize-with-node-js-and-mysql#connecting-to-the-mysql-database), as that includes the initiate `Sequelize()` method and database initiation. Paste the contents into a new file called `array_raw_query.js`. Update the database name to `sample_student_db`:

/hello-world/array_raw_query.js

```javascript
const {Sequelize, DataTypes} = require("sequelize");

const sequelize = new Sequelize(
   'sample_student_db',
   'DATABASE_USERNAME',
   'DATABASE_PASSWORD',
    {
      host: 'DATABASE_HOST',
      dialect: 'mysql'
    }
   );

sequelize.authenticate().then(() => {
    console.log('Connection has been established successfully.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to connect to the database: ', error);
});
```

Copy

At the end of the file, add the following code block for an array replacement, making sure to replace `REPLACE_STUDENT_ID` with the `student_id` value that you copied in the previous section.

/hello-world/array_raw_query.js

```javascript
...
sequelize.query(
    'SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = ?',
    {
      replacements: ['REPLACE_STUDENT_ID'],
      type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT
    }
).then(result => {
    console.log(result);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to insert data : ', error);
});
```

Copy

For array replacement, you pass the `query()` method with the SQL query and the configuration object. It contains the `replacements` value and type. To replacements, you pass data as an array and catch those values using the question mark (`?`) symbol.

Next, since you need to get data about a specific student, the `student_id` is passed as the second parameter. After that, you pass the `type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT` key-value pair, which you can use to select data from the database.

There are some other types as well, such as `QueryTypes.UPDATE` and `QueryTypes.DELETE`. Depending on the requirement, you can select the type that suits your purpose.

The following shows the full code block. Here you connect to the database and retrieve the selected student data using a raw query.

/hello-world/array_raw_query.js

```javascript
const {Sequelize, DataTypes} = require("sequelize");

const sequelize = new Sequelize(
   'sample_student_db',
   'DATABASE_USERNAME',
   'DATABASE_PASSWORD',
    {
      host: 'DATABASE_HOST',
      dialect: 'mysql'
    }
   );

sequelize.authenticate().then(() => {
    console.log('Connection has been established successfully.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to connect to the database: ', error);
});

sequelize.query(
    'SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = ?',
    {
      replacements: ['REPLACE_STUDENT_ID'],
      type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT
    }
).then(result => {
    console.log(result);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to insert data : ', error);
});
```

Copy

Save and close your file.

Next, you can run this script using the following command:

```bash
node array_raw_query.js
```

Copy

You will see output similar to the following:

```
OutputConnection has been established successfully.
[ { student_id: 'STUDENT_ID_YOU_RETRIEVED',
    name: 'Robert Gray',
    createdAt: 2022-05-06T13:14:50.000Z,
    updatedAt: 2022-05-06T13:14:50.000Z } ]
```

Due to the selected `student_id`, your output values may differ.

### Object Replacement

On the surface, object replacement is similar to array replacement, but the pattern of passing data to the raw query is different. In the replacement option, you pass data as an object, and in the query option, you use values like `:key`.

To get started, create a new file called `object_raw_query.js` and paste the complete code blocks from the `server.js` file, updating the database to `sample_student_db`.

/hello-world/array_raw_query.js

```javascript
const {Sequelize, DataTypes} = require("sequelize");

const sequelize = new Sequelize(
   'sample_student_db',
   'DATABASE_USERNAME',
   'DATABASE_PASSWORD',
    {
      host: 'DATABASE_HOST',
      dialect: 'mysql'
    }
   );

sequelize.authenticate().then(() => {
    console.log('Connection has been established successfully.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to connect to the database: ', error);
});
```

Copy

Then, add the following code block to the end of the new `object_raw_query.js` file:

/hello-world/object_raw_query.js

```javascript
...
sequelize.query(
  'SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = :id',
  {
    replacements: { id: 'REPLACE_STUDENT_ID' },
    type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT
  }
 ).then(result => {
    console.log(result);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to insert data : ', error);
});
```

Copy

Here, you get selected student data using the object replacement method. You create a `replacement` object, setting the `id` as the student information you wish to retrieve: `{ id: 'REPLACE_STUDENT_ID' }`.

In the `query()`, you indicate: `'SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = :id'`. Using the `query()` method, you pass the replacement value as an object, which is why this method is known as object replacement.

Here is the complete code:

/hello-world/object_raw_query.js

```javascript
const {Sequelize, DataTypes} = require("sequelize");

const sequelize = new Sequelize(
   'sample_student_db',
   'DATABASE_USERNAME',
   'DATABASE_PASSWORD',
    {
      host: 'DATABASE_HOST',
      dialect: 'mysql'
    }
   );

sequelize.authenticate().then(() => {
    console.log('Connection has been established successfully.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unable to connect to the database: ', error);
});

sequelize.query(
  'SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = :id',
  {
    replacements: { id: 'REPLACE_STUDENT_ID' },
    type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT
  }
 ).then(result => {
    console.log(result);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to insert data : ', error);
});
```

Copy

Save and close the file.

Next, run this script using the following command:

```bash
node object_raw_query.js
```

Copy

The output will look similar to the following:

```
OutputConnection has been established successfully.
[ { student_id: 'STUDENT_ID_YOU_RETRIEVED',
    name: 'Robert Gray',
    createdAt: 2022-05-06T13:14:50.000Z,
    updatedAt: 2022-05-06T13:14:50.000Z } ]
```

Due to the selected `student_id`, your output values may differ.

In this step, you worked with Sequelize raw queries using two different methodologies: array replacement and object replacement.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you installed and configured Sequelize. You also created and worked with models, which is one of the mandatory components of Sequelize. Finally, you created different types of associations and worked with raw queries using practical examples.

Next, you can use different data types to create database models. You can also update and delete records in databases with both built-in methods and raw queries.
