fieldtype change to "other" can be picked up by onPatientClick
also implies a past product

remove old product and fieldType from window object

submitType implies that 

if fieldType is other, then we're redirected to dashboard
this setting works if we're inheriting from window
if type submitted, we should always move to product type

create a new branch

when we return to dashboard, it gets profile from windows.user
so if we created a windows.user in past
it will defer to that

if we create a brand new user, this should never happen
try this tonight.
