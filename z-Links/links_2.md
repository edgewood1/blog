Plato believed we all reflected the good, but some of us better reflected it than others; and all of us could improve that reflection if we admit our reflection is partly flawed. 

Could we change the study lock expiration by changing the code or is admin/settings the only way?

Could I change a line of our code so that it pretty quickly goes into lock-mode? 

I ask because the mobile study-detail page breaks after the 5 min lock period is over.

Hey, currently, cs-feature/admin settings has the 'Study Lock" setting at 5 min.  I could change that in admin settings, and then I'd have to re-deploy that server.
