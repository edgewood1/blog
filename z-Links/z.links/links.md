corporeal substance has dimension and shape, and thus is composite and divisible.  The soul is not corporeal, it is indivisible.  When it is present at one point of the body, all of it is there at that point.  

The soul has simplicity - it is a singularity.  it is wihtout quantity.  yet it has a multiplicity of powers.  - the power to see, hear, smell, think, will.  These all require the operation of respective bodily organs.  but thought and will does not.  

while teh whole soul is in every cell fo the body, all its powers are not - power of sight in the eye, etc.  the soul is in many parts through many powers, not in each part through all of its powers.
