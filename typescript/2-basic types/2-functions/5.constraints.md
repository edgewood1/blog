**Constraints**

Sometimes we want to 

- relate two values AND
- **restrict** which values those might be

We can do this via a **extends** clause.  This function does the following: 

- recieves two arguments of type `Type`
- however, `Type` must have a `length` property whose type is `number`
- Here, we ensure that Type must have a property length:

```tsx
function longest<Type extends { length: number }>(a: Type, b: Type) {
  if (a.length >= b.length) {
    return a;
  } else {
    return b;
  }
}
```

Now see the results.  What data types contain a built-in length property?

- Array and string
- but not Number: 

```
// longerArray is of type 'number[]'  This has an Array, which has a length property, so OK
const longerArray = longest([1, 2], [1, 2, 3]);
// longerString is of type 'string'
const longerString = longest("alice", "bob");
```

TS infers the return type of `longest`

- without the extends, we wouldn't be able to access `length` prop of parameters a and b
- `longerArray` and `longerString` are inferred based on arguments

```
// Error! Numbers don't have a 'length' property
const notOK = longest(10, 100);
Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ length: number; }'.
```

**Specifying Types**

This function takes 2 arguments with these constraints: 

- they must be arrays
- the array items must be of the same type

And it returns an array whose items are of the same type

```tsx
function combine<Type>(arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[] {
  return arr1.concat(arr2);
}
```

Here, the 2 array have different types of array items:

```
const arr = combine([1, 2, 3], ["hello"]);Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```

However, you could manually set  `Type`  

So into the type parameter  `<Type>`  , we are passing in this type argument: `<string | number>`   

```
const arr = combine<string | number>([1, 2, 3], ["hello"]);
```

Which is like saying: 

```tsx
function combine<string|number>(arr1: string|number[], arr2: string|number[]): string|number[] {
  return arr1.concat(arr2);
}
```

**Some Guidelines for Generic Functions**

- When possible, use the type parameter itself rather than constraining it because the constraint could reduce the specifity of the type

- Always use as few type parameters as possible / Make sure a generic type parameter does indeed relate tow values

- If a type parameter only appears in one location, strongly reconsider if you actually need it
