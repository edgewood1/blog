You're correct, and I appreciate your observation. Combining points 5 and 6 makes sense since both discuss aspects related to recasting or type conversions. Let's consolidate those sections:

# Type Inference and Annotations

__Type Inference__ - If we don't use type annotation, TypeScript (TS) will make an educated guess based on the value.

Example:

```typescript
var apples = 5; // TS assumes this is a number
```

Thus, we often save annotations for objects.

**Contextual Typing:**

A subset of type inference where TS looks at the location to assume the type.

Example:

```typescript
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];
names.forEach(function (s) {
  console.log(s.toUppercase()); // Expects `s` to be a string
});
```

Example with the event object:

```typescript
window.onmousedown = function (mouseEvent) {
  console.log(mouseEvent.button); // OK
  console.log(mouseEvent.kangaroo); // Error!
};

window.onscroll = function (uiEvent) {
  console.log(uiEvent.button); // Error! Scroll is a mouse event, not a uiEvent
};
```

**Annotations and Assertion**

- **Annotations:** A set of explanatory notes.
- **Type Annotation:** An explicit statement of a variable's data type.

Two ways of assigning type:

- Declaration by interface:

```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
}
const john: Person = { name: 'John' };
// Now, you can only add `name` as a property
```

- Declaration by type:

```typescript
const x: string = 'hello';
```

- **Assertion:**

Used to change a type: increase, maintain, or decrease specificity.

Example:

```typescript
const bingo = { name: 'Bingo' } as Person;
```

Assertion syntax: angle-bracket

```typescript
type c = {
	hobby: string
}
const b = <c>a; // Adding a `c` property to our object

<c>a.hobby = 'string'; // Not applicable
```

- **Type Recasting and Recasting**

Change from a string to number via recasting:

```typescript
var s = '1';  // s is a string
var s2: number;  // Define a new variable via type assertion
var s2 = <number><any> s; // <target-type> + target variable
```

**Do Assertions Require a New Variable?**

```typescript
let a: typeA;
let b = a as typeB;
```

**Review: Ways of Creating Declarations**

- Colon:

```typescript
let myStr: string;  // Declaring a variable with its type as string
```

- As - here, the variable has one type, but you want to use it as another type:

```typescript
let strLength = (myStr as string).length; // Now length is available
```

- <> on the left - alternative to #2:

```typescript
let strLength = <string>myStr.length;
```

- <> on the right (generics) - The user can define the items in the array as a number or an array; the right type is passed in when the function is called. Only use if you will use in at least 2 places:

```typescript
function getArray<T>(items: T[]): T[] {
    return new Array<T>().concat(items);
}

let myNumArr = getArray<number>([100, 200, 300]);
let myStrArr = getArray<string>(["Hello", "World"]);

myNumArr.push(400); // OK
myStrArr.push("Hello TypeScript"); // OK

myNumArr.push("Hi"); // Compiler Error
myStrArr.push(500); // Compiler Error
```
```
