**Annotations**

​	**Annotation**-  a set of explanatory notes.

​	**Type annotation**- an explicity statment of a variables data-type 

**Two ways of assigning type**

- declaration by interface

```
interface Person {
    name: string;
}
const john: Person = { name: 'John' }
// now you can only add `name` as a prop:
john = {name: 'john', age: 5} // not allowed
```

- declaration by ---

```
 const x: string = 'hello';
```



**Assertion - used to change a type: increase, maintain, decrease specificity**

```
const bingo = { name: 'Bingo' } as Person
```

Now, we assert type `oz` on a.  It is no longer merely an object:  

```tsx
type oz = {
	name: string
}

type az = {
	age: number
}
(a as oz).name = 'mel'; // changes 
(a as az).age = 5;
```

**Assertion syntax: angle-bracket**

```tsx
type c = {
	hobby: string
}
const b = <c>a   // adding a `c` property to our object

<c>a.hobby = 'string'; // not applicable
```

 

**Type recasting**

Element > HTMLElement > HTMLInputElement

Two ways of typecasting

- Downcasting - *Element* could be cast as *HTMLInputElement* or ...  (making more specific)

```
let el: HTMLElement as HTMLInputElement...
//Or
let el: HTMLElement; 
el = new HTMLInputElement();
```

TypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a *more specific* or *less specific* version of a type. This rule prevents “impossible” coercions like:

```
const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") // TS sees this as HTMLElement
const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;Try
or
const myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");
```

Like a type annotation, type assertions are removed by the compiler and won’t affect the runtime behavior of your code.

You can also use the angle-bracket syntax (except if the code is in a `.tsx` file), which is equivalent:

```
const myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");
```



**Recasting**

Change from a string to number via recasting

```
var s = '1'  // s is a string
var s2: number. // define a new variable via type assertion
var s2 = <number><any> s // <target-type> + target variable
```

 

**Do assertions require a new variable?**

```
*let* a: typeA;
*let* b = a as typeB;
```

**Review: ways of creating declarations:** 

- Colon

```
*let* myStr: *string*;  // declaring a variable with its type as string
```

- As - here, the variable has one type, but you want to use it as another type.   

```
let strLength = (myStr as string).length; // now length available 
```

- <> on left - altrnative to #2

```
let strLength = <string>myStr.length; 
```

- <> on right (generics). - *the user can define the items in the array as number or array; the right type is passed in when the function is called.  Only use if you will use in at least 2 places. 

```
function getArray<T>(items : T[] ) : T[] {
    return new Array<T>().concat(items);
}

let myNumArr = getArray<number>([100, 200, 300]);
let myStrArr = getArray<string>(["Hello", "World"]);

myNumArr.push(400); // OK
myStrArr.push("Hello TypeScript"); // OK

myNumArr.push("Hi"); // Compiler Error
myStrArr.push(500); // Compiler Error
```
