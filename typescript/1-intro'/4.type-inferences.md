__type inference__ - if we don't use type-annotation, TS will make an educated guess based on the value

`var apples = 5` 

- TS will assume this is a number

- thus, we mostly save annotation for objects.  



**Contextual-typing.**

This is a subset of type inference.

type inference sees `var a=5` and uses the value to assume the type:  a number

with contextual-typing, TS looks at the  location to assume the type: 

Below, we loop through an array of strings, so we can assume in a `forEach` that each item will be a string: 

```js
// No type annotations here, but TS knows these are all strings
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]; 
// Contextual typing for function
names.forEach(function (s) {  console.log(s.toUppercase());
// Thus, it expects `s` to be a string 

```

`mouseEvent` is an event object that arises from the `onmousedown` event, and so it expects this event object to have `mouseEvent` methods.

```js
window.onmousedown = function (mouseEvent) { // TS knows `onmousedown` and used it to infer `mouseEvent`, which doesn't have a kangaroo prop
  console.log(mouseEvent.button); //<- OK
  console.log(mouseEvent.kangaroo); //<- Error!
};
```

`uiEvent` is the object that naturally arises from `onscroll` so again, we can expect this to have certain methods; if not, we would need to extend this.

```
window.onscroll = function (uiEvent) {
  console.log(uiEvent.button); //<- Error! scroll is a mouseevent not a uiEvent
};

```
