What is typescript

syntactical sugar. 

This means

 It is a strict syntactical [superset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superset) of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and adds optional [static typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing) to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and [transcompiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) to JavaScript.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript#cite_note-5) As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both [client-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side) and [server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) execution (as with [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) or [Deno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deno_(software))). There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript#cite_note-6) or the [Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_(transcompiler)) compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **syntactic sugar** is [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) within a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.

For example, many programming languages provide special syntax for referencing and updating [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type) elements. Abstractly, an array reference is a procedure of two arguments: an array and a subscript vector, which could be expressed as `get_array(Array, vector(i,j))`. Instead, many languages provide syntax such as `Array[i,j]`. Similarly an array element update is a procedure consisting of three arguments, for example `set_array(Array, vector(i,j), value)`, but many languages provide syntax such as `Array[i,j] = value`.

A construct in a language is syntactic sugar if it can be removed from the language without any effect on what the language can do: [functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(engineering)) and [expressive power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_power_(computer_science)) will remain the same.

Language processors, including [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) and [static analyzers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis), often expand sugared constructs into more fundamental constructs before processing, a process sometimes called "desugaring".

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), the **syntax** of a [computer language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language) is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)) or [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)) in that language. This applies both to [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), where the document represents [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code), and to [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), where the document represents data.

The syntax of a language defines its surface form.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)#cite_note-eopl-1) [Text-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) computer languages are based on sequences of [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)), while [visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_languages) are based on the spatial layout and connections between symbols (which may be textual or graphical). Documents that are syntactically invalid are said to have a [syntax error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error). When designing the syntax of a language, a designer might start by writing down examples of both legal and illegal [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)), before trying to figure out the general rules from these examples.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)#cite_note-2)

Syntax therefore refers to the *form* of the code, and is contrasted with [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) â€“ the *meaning*. In processing computer languages, semantic processing generally comes after syntactic processing; however, in some cases, semantic processing is necessary for complete syntactic analysis, and these are done together or [concurrently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)). In a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), the syntactic analysis comprises the [frontend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_frontend), while the [semantic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_analysis_(compilers)) comprises the [backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_backend) (and middle end, if this phase is distinguished).

Compile vs runtime

**Compilation/Compile time/Syntax/Semantic errors:** Compilation or compile time errors are error occurred due to typing mistake, if we do not follow the proper syntax and semantics of any programming language then compile time errors are thrown by the compiler. They wont let your program to execute a single line until you remove all the syntax errors or until you debug the compile time errors.
Example: Missing a semicolon in C or mistyping `int` as `Int`.

**Runtime errors:** Runtime errors are the errors that are generated when the program is in running state. These types of errors will cause your program to behave unexpectedly or may even kill your program. They are often referred as Exceptions.
Example: Suppose you are reading a file that doesn't exist, will result in a runtime error.
