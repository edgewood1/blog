#Syntactic sugar - a language layer that makes things easier to ready.If an array procedure requires three arguments, for example `set_array(Array, vector(i,j), value)`, but many languages provide syntax such as `Array[i,j] = value`.

kinds of langague processors expand sugared constructs into more fundamental constructs before processings - they desugar it. 
compilers - 
static analyzers - 

syntax - set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols or expressions.   
semantics - the meaning of the code.  semantic processing comes after syntactic processing.  however, in some cases, semantic processing is necessary for complete syntactic analysis, and these are done together.

Compile vs runtime errors

- we type code
- when we run program, the enging compiles the code into something it can run.  An error here is a compile error.  It is the result of a typo
- when the code runs, an error that occurs due to a throw, for example, which terminates app, is a runtime error.  It is the result of logic
