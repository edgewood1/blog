**Compile time vs run time**

Compile time - code converted to a form the computer can run

Runtime - after compilation, the period when program is launched and is running

**static - dynamic axis**

statically typed languages - check types / type errors during compile time; it checks types before running the program

dynamically typed languages - check types / type errors during runtime; it checks types while running the program

**Weak -strong axis**

weak - language assumes and converts type a lot.  `var x = 4` might turn into `x ='4'` `x=1` might turn into `x=true` 

Strong - language doesn't do this.  if you try to assign a string to a number, you will get push back

__typescript__ =  superset of javascript

 - strong typing - if we assign a value to a var tha tis not fo the same type, errors... 
 - has a compile stage, so compile-time errors can be found
 - great tooling (intellisense)
 - must be transpiled into js

 

`PROCESS`

- install typescript: npm install -g typescript
- create main.ts and code
- transpile to main.js: tsc <filename>  

**Data types**

A data type - formalize / enforces the kinds of value that variable will hold; it is an attribute of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) which tells the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) or [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) how the programmer intends to use the data. A data type constrains the values that an [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)), such as a variable or a function, might take. This data type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be store

 **Three kinds of types**

built-in types:  boolean, string, object... voiD (primitive and objects)

TS-specific types - Array, any (super-type)

custom types: You can also combine basic types using type operators

__user-defined types__ : enumerations (enums), classes, interfaces, arrays, tuples


null and undefined are subtypes of other types

let isNew: boolean = null;
let myName: string = undefined;
