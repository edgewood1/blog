Functions 

```js
function merge(a: object, b: object) {
  return Object.assign(a, b);
}

const mergeObj = merge({name: 'max'}, {age: 5}) 
```

the function can't access mergedObj.age because its typed as object and `age` is not a property of the `object` type.   

we can type case: merge() as {name: string, age: number}

An alternative: 

```ts
function merge<T, U>(a: T, b: U) {
  .... 
}
```

 infers that this function merges the intersection of a + be

```ts
function merge<T, U> (a: T, b: U): T & U 
```

T will know its an object with specific keys 
types set dynamically when its called. 
T will vary depending on what's being passed in.  

we can also do this

```
function merge<{name:string}, {age: number}> ....
```

but generics do this. 

If we want to restrict the generic type via type contrainsts: 

`function merge<T extends object>(obj: T)` ... now obj must be an object 

we can pass a string or array: 

```
function count<T>(el: T) {
  let des = 'no value';
  if (el.length > 1 ) des = got many des
  if (el.length === 1) des = got one des
  return [el, des];
}
```

above complains about length b/c its not clear that el has a length method 
so we create an interface. 

```
interface len {
  length: number; 
}
```

then above we extend T - also, we note return... 

`function count<T extends len>(el: T): [T, string]`

via len, we have told typescript that T has a method...

this creates an error bc obj could be {} which has no keys: 

```
function extract(obj: object, key: string) {
  return obj[key]
}
```

so use generic

```
function extract< T extends object, U extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: U)
```

key should be a key of obj - if its not.
